'''Spider-Bitch''' ('''Ashley Barton''') ([[Colloquialism|colloquially]] known as '''\"Spider-Woman\"''' or '''\"Spider-Girl\"''') is a [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Steve McNiven]], the character first appeared in [[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #67 (September [[2008 in comics|2008]]). She is the estranged daughter of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]'s youngest daughter [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|Tonya]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]], and the stepdaughter of Tonya's husband [[Ultron#Old Man Logan|Ultron-8]], from the [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate-future]] of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#List of main alternate Earths and universes|Earth-807128/21923]], in which the supervillains overthrew the [[superhero]]es three decades earlier.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Collins |first=Hannah |date=December 14, 2018 |title=40 Alternate Spider-Man Costumes, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/every-alternate-spider-man-costume-ranked |access-date=February 12, 2023 |website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] |language=en}}</ref> Having no [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], after being saved from execution by her estranged father and [[Old Man Logan]] in 2008's ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' storyline, Spider-Bitch kills the current [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin of Crime]], succeeding him as the '''Kingpin of the Wastelands''', revealing her true villainous nature, before unsuccessfully attempting to kill her father and Logan.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jung |first=Michael |date=April 27, 2020 |title=10 Spider-Men (& Women) With Racially Diverse Backgrounds |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-men-and-women-racially-diverse-backgrounds/ |access-date=February 12, 2023 |website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] |language=en}}</ref>

While usually portrayed as a [[supervillain]], Spider-Bitch has also been occasionally depicted as a conflicted [[antihero]]. In the 2014\u201315 \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" storyline, set after ''Old Man Logan'', Spider-Bitch is among the first recruited to a [[resistance movement]] against [[Inheritors (comics)|the Inheritors]]' consumption of [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|Spider-People]] across the [[Spider-Verse]] by [[the Superior Spider-Man]], [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]], in order to devise a plan to [[Genocide|kill them all]]; in the aftermath of the conflict, Spider-Bitch continues to explore the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], assisting various teams of Spider-People while funnelling resources back to her home dimension until the 2018 ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' storyline and [[Spider-Geddon#Tie-ins|''Spider-Force'']] [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], following which she returns to her reality, seven years having passed, and reclaims her throne from [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]] in 2019's [[Star-Lord#Old Man Quill|''Old Man Quill'']] storyline, continuing her plans to [[World domination|take over the world]].

Receiving a generally positive critical reception, the character was adapted to the 2021 [[radio drama]] [[podcast]] series ''[[Marvel's Wastelanders]]'' as '''Ash Morse / King Zemo''', voiced by [[Sasha Lane]].

In the future of ''[[Old Man Logan]]'', thirty years after the supervillains overthrew the superheroes, the [[Old Man Logan|title character]] and the now-blind [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]] are passing through Hammer Falls, [[Nevada]] after Clint hired Logan as protection while delivering a shipment cross-country, when the pair are greeted by [[Ultron#Old Man Logan|Ultron Eight]], the current husband of Clint's third ex-wife Tonya (the youngest daughter of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]) and stepfather to their 22-year-old daughter '''Ashley''', both of whom Clint had left when she was three months old with limited contact since. Assuming Clint is there because of a letter Tonya had sent him, Ultron is surprised to learn that he hasn't received it and directs him to Tonya, who informs Clint that Ashley and her friends, apparently inspired by stories of Clint and her grandfather, had formed a super-team and gone north to [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] to take down the current [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin of Crime]] (the [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] incarnation from [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'']]), before being captured and set to be [[Public execution|publicly executed]] the following morning; Ashley is shown to be in a prison cell to be dressed in a costume similar to that of the deceased [[Spider-Woman|Spider-Women]] and her aunt [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Mayday Parker / Spider-Girl]].<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #67 (September [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Surprised, having \"never really had Ashley pegged as the superhero type\", telling Tonya that he had gotten the impression that she was an \"evil badass type [who] never really seemed especially altruistic\" from the few encounters he had had with her, Clint nonetheless agrees to rescue her and doubles Logan's salary to convince him to help him rescue her. While en route, passing through [[Cedar City]], Clint tells Logan that while surprised, he is \"so friggin' ''proud''\" of his daughter; meanwhile, in the [[Rice\u2013Eccles Stadium]] in Salt Lake City (now Fisk Lake City), the Kingpin feeds the other members of Ashley's team, successors to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Punisher|the Punisher]], to ''[[utahraptor]]s'' while bragging over having killed [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] during his rise to power, as the pair beg to know what they had done to Ashley. Elsewhere, in her cell inside a customized [[Walmart]]-turned-prison, Ashley, known as \"Spider-Bitch\", sits silently as some of her guards mock the concept of superheroes, before Clint and Logan crash their [[Spider-Mobile]] through the wall of the prison. Stating \"That'll be Dad.\" upon hearing the crash, Ashley watches as her father massacre the guards before telling him precisely where on the wall the [[control panel (engineering)|control panel]] for her cell is so he can open it, shooting it with an arrow. As the Kingpin enters the room to see what the commotion is, the newly freed Ashley immediately decapitates him by swinging the end of a shotgun into his neck, before knocking a surprised Clint to the ground: Ashley explains that she and her team came to the area not as superheroes, but as [[supervillain]]s, intending to seize control of the Kingpin's Quarter (formerly [[Las Vegas]]) by killing him, the same way the Kingpin himself had taken over as [[dictator]] by killing Magneto. As she prepares to beat her father to death,<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #68 (October [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Ashley tells him that she's \"doing it because I want to\", before Logan, having witnessed Ashley's actions, crashes through the skylight in the Spider-Mobile and rescues Clint. Overlooking the escaping duo, Ashley orders a segment of her new army to go after them, before taking her rightful place on her throne as '''Spider-Bitch, the Kingpin of the Wastelands'''.<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #69 (November [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> While drinking at a bar with the following day, Clint regrets not being involved in his daughter's life, recalling the day she was born and how she was the first thing she ever saw;<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #70 (December [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> these events are also witnessed by a time-displaced [[Tempus (Eva Bell)|Eva Bell]].<ref>[[All-New X-Men|''All-New X-Men'' Annual Vol. 1]] #1 (December [[2014 in comics|2014]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In the [[prequel]] series [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Old Man Logan|''Old Man Hawkeye'']] (Jan.\u2013Dec.

Hearing from Tonya that Ashley had recently gotten in trouble for fighting, Clint is initially proud to hear that she had beaten up a bully who had in turn been \"beating up one of the fat kids\" and stealing his money, only to learn that she had beaten them both up due the \"fat kid\" having been paying her for protection, and she was insulted by the \"disrespect\" he had showed by keeping money from her. Dismissing her father's attempts at small talk, Ashley asks Clint why he is really there.
