The '''Gremlin''' (born '''Kondrati Topolov''')<ref>''Iron Man Manual Mark 3''</ref> is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #163 (May 1973).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=158}}</ref>

Although initially an adversary of the [[Hulk]], the Gremlin is apparently killed in battle with [[Iron Man]] during the [[Armor Wars]].

==Concept and creation==
Co-creator [[Steve Englehart]] recounted, \"I\u2019ve always treated the entire run of a book, up to the point that I took it over, as worthy of respect. So I was always interested in where series started out, and how they developed in their early days. The [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] had indeed been in ''[[Hulk]]'' #1, so I thought it would be fun to connect to him\u2014but I had to make something interesting for my time, not just wave at the past. I thought, \u2018Gargoyle + Kremlin = Gremlin\u2019.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title= Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|page= 8|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Kondrati Topolov is the son of Russian scientist Yuri Topolov, also known as the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]], and is himself a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. Kondrati inherited his father's grotesque appearance and superhuman intelligence, although he was born disfigured unlike his father, who was mutated over time due to exposure to radioactive materials. His father was cured by a captured [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] using gamma rays and died killing other Soviets in an explosion.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #1</ref> A brilliant scientist like his father, he created the high-tech gear used by the Soviet Super-Troopers (the immediate precursor to the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]]), and for a time wore the [[Titanium Man]] [[power armor]]. He operated out of a secret base named Bitterfrost in Khystym, Siberia. He created a pet for himself named Droog, which was an intelligent, talking, ''[[Triceratops]]''-like monster created through genetic engineering.

As the Gremlin, he first clashed with the [[Hulk]] at the Gremlin's secret base in the Arctic. Gremlin's men then captured General [[Thunderbolt Ross|\"Thunderbolt\" Ross]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #163</ref> The Hulk and General Ross later invaded the Gremlin's Bitterfrost base in Siberia to rescue the captured Major [[Glenn Talbot]]. The Gremlin and his pet Droog contended with the Hulk, but Bitterfrost was destroyed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #187-188</ref> Later, with the Soviet Super-Soldiers, [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]], the Gremlin helped defeat the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s. The Gremlin then officially joined the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>''Rom'' #44</ref>

The Gremlin next appeared as the second [[Titanium Man]], wearing a new suit of the power armor he had originally created for Boris Bullsky. With the other Soviet Super-Soldiers, he contended with the [[X-Men]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in an attempt to capture [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''X-Men vs. the Avengers'' #1-3</ref> Later, the Gremlin fought [[Iron Man]] while wearing the Titanium Man armor during the \"[[Armor Wars]]\". Iron Man - despite using his weaker stealth armor - managed to defeat the [[Crimson Dynamo]] in the fight but was unable to neutralize the Gremlin, who destroyed Iron Man's negator pack. When the Gremlin grabbed Iron Man and the armored Avenger attempted to escape, his booster jets ignited the [[titanium]] armor. The Titanium Man armor exploded, apparently burning the Gremlin to death within it and forcing Iron Man to flee.<ref>''Iron Man'' #229</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Gremlin is a mutant who has inherited the immense intelligence of his father, the Gargoyle, where he gained it from an atomic accident. He had completed [[Doctorate|doctoral program]]s in various sciences and attained mastery over many areas of technology. Towards the end of his career, he wore the Titanium Man battlesuit that granted him tremendous strength, physical resistance, hypersonic flight, and the ability to utilize energy as weapons.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' #5 (November 2008)</ref>

==Other characters named Gremlin==
* There was a Gremlin who appeared in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #61. He is an agent of Doctor Hydro and one of his Hydro-Men where he hijacked an airplane that [[Namorita]] and Betty Dean Prentiss were on. The Gremlin used a disc which could hypnotize others.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #61</ref>
