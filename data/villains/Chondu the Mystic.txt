'''Chondu the Mystic''', sometimes known as '''Chondu the Magician''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Chondu the Mystic first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #9 and was created by Doug Wildley and [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]] while his monstrous form was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Chondu was once a sideshow [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] before becoming a professional criminal. In his first appearance, he lectured on yoga and sent an escaped convict to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #9</ref>

Chondu later joins the [[Headmen]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #21</ref> Dr. [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Arthur Nagan)|Arthur Nagan]] transplants Chondu's brain into [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk's]] body in a bid to exploit the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. [[Doctor Strange]] defeats him in a fight and mystically places Chondu's consciousness in a fawn's body. Meanwhile, Nagan and Ruby Thursday carry out a series of alterations to Chondu's original body. His altered body is a monstrous, demonic-looking form with eight lampreys for arms, bird-wings, a horn from his skull, fangs, a forked tongue, and eagles' feet. His consciousness is placed in an artificial brain made out of the same material as Ruby's head. Chondu attempts to kidnap a construction worker to use in a brain transplant, but encounters [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and is arrested by the New York City police.<ref>''The Defenders'' #31-33, 35</ref>

The Headmen later hire [[Mysterio]] to capture the [[She-Hulk]], and place Chondu's head on a clone of her body, which he does not appreciate. She-Hulk and [[Spider-Man]] battle the Headmen, and in the course of the fight Chondu's head is knocked free from its new body. He survives thanks to life-support equipment attached to his head.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #1-3</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Chondu has been seen as a bartender at the '''Bar with no Doors''', a tavern frequented by various mystics.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 4 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chondu can perform intermediate magic as he is skilled in the mystic arts. In this [[Chimera (genetics)|composite]] form, he has immense physical attributes, winged flight, the ability to constrict people or objects with his tentacle-like arms, and razor-sharp weapons.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #2 (May 2008)</ref>
