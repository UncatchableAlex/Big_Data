==Fictional character biography==
Basil Sandhurst was born in [[Kittery Point, Maine]]. Sandhurst worked as an electro-mechanical/chemical research scientist. His obsession with control brought his downfall as a scientist when his refusal to obey ethical restraints got him banned from most research facilities. Sandhurst was prone to fits of rage and in an attempt to calm him, his brother Vincent inadvertently triggered a lab explosion, crippling Basil. Vincent, guilt-ridden, outfitted Basil with an automated lab in which Basil bonded a super-strong exoskeleton to his body, powered by the cerebral energies from those around him using his slave discs.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=66}}</ref> As the Controller, he planned to invade and enslave New York City, but [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Jasper Sitwell]] foiled his scheme and left the Controller comatose.<ref>''Iron Man'' #13.

He created an improved set of equipment but was again defeated by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Months later, he was released from prison by the alien [[Thanos]], who upgraded his technology. Thanos promised the Controller rulership of Earth, and so he began enslaving dozens of operatives. He invaded [[Avengers Mansion]] and defeated the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]], and abducted Lou-Ann Savannah. The Controller's egotistical displays endangered Thanos's security, and when the Controller failed to defeat Thanos's enemy, Captain Marvel, the alien left him for dead.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #28, 30. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Controller went underground for years, upgrading via Stark technology stolen from [[Justin Hammer]], and eventually enslaved a cult. He set the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] against Iron Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Iron Man defeated him and imprisoned him in a vat of experimental plastic, but he escaped. Alongside one of the Blood Brothers, he fought Iron Man, but Iron Man defeated him once more and he was confined to the prison for supervillains called the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #88-91. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually broke out of jail, only to be defeated by Iron Man again. During the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]],\" the Controller escaped from the Vault and at the behest of the [[Red Skull]], he enslaved [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and set him against [[Captain America]]. He unsuccessfully attempted to control [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] at the behest of the Red Skull, and unsuccessfully attempted to aid the Red Skull against [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. He was ultimately defeated by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #365-367. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Revived by the world-conquering [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]], the Controller became the Master's pawn against the Avengers and [[Heroes for Hire]]. Abandoned after a later defeat, the Controller, in an ironic nod to his many hospitalizations, acquired his own clinic, where he influenced the wealthy to do his bidding. However, the Controller could not resist enslaving [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as well, leading to his latest defeat by Iron Man.

Returned to The Raft, the Controller escaped with dozens of others but was recaptured during a clash with the [[U-Foes]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=\"Avengers.\">{{

During the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline, the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Super-Human Registration Act. He appears as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes; the grouping is intent on defeating the Skrull invasion force of New York City.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Maria Hill]] found the Controller holed up in the basement of a Futurepharm facility in Austin, Texas, while on orders from Tony Stark.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #11</ref> He had been abducting members of the local populace for months to bolster a new army and attempted to brainwash Hill as well. However, she resisted his efforts and freed his drones, sabotaging the entire operation.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Controller gave White Fang a new suit so that she could kill the Hood.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Controller later appears in [[Boston]], assembling major crime families together in an Italian restaurant. When the Avengers invade the restaurant, the Controller uses his control discs on the criminals as well as [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], but he is defeated by [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]]. After the Avengers defeat the first wave of Leviathon monsters, the Controller tries to put a control disc on Thor, but he is stopped by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''The Avengers'' Vol. 7 #1.MU. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when Tony Stark rebranded his company as Stark Unlimited, Controller infiltrated it while enslaving Bethany Cabe.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He set his sights on the virtual reality program called the eScape.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Controller proceeded to tamper with the eScape so he could enthrall the minds of those who use it, resulting in large numbers of the worst eScape users being banned, then let back into the eScape and armed with real weapons that they unknowingly used to wreak havoc all over the world, and whom he siphoned energy from. Tony and his allies were able to trace Controller's location and head there to confront him. By the time they arrived, Iron Man found that Controller had consumed enough energy to grow in size.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Because of Controller's hacking, it damaged the Motherboard A.I. who served as the operating system. Motherboard proceeded to abduct Iron Man leaving the others underpowered against a giant-sized Controller. After Andy Bhang was able to encode a signal to shut off the tampered interfaces, upon returning to the real world, Tony hijacked Baintronics' factory to make a 3D print of the Godbuster armor which he used to defeat Controller.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #8-11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Controller later accompanied [[Korvac]], Blizzard, and Unicorn in fighting Iron Man and Hellcat.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 6 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Basil Sandhurst had designed this armored exoskeleton, which is micro-surgically attached to his body from head and toe that granted him mobility, as well as augmented strength, stamina, and durability. By utilizing the microcircuitry in this helmet, he can drain [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[energies]] from people to power up his exoskeleton, magnify its strength, and duplicate their abilities. He has limited psychic capabilities, such as the ability to control a person's actions via \"slave disc\" or project bolts of mental force from his helmet. The Controller could telepathically manipulate \"weak-willed\" subjects even without the discs. His exoskeleton have included image inducers, stun mists, and other technologies as needed.<ref>''The New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'' Vol 1 #1 (December 2005)</ref>

The Controller originally utilized a [[Brainwave|mind wave]] Absorbatron to convert the mental energy for use by his exoskeleton, although this device was rendered obsolete after Thanos improved Sandhurst's equipment. The discs now increase his physical attributes in geometric progression to a number of victims wearing slave discs and control their actions all at once.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #2 (May 2008)</ref>

With his college degree, Sandhurst is also an expert chemist and mechanical engineer.

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' reality, Sandhurst was mentioned as one of the many who were killed when [[Norman Osborn]] rose to power.<ref>''Earth X'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>
