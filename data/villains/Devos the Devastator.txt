'''Devos the Devastator''' is a <!--Do not add \"fictional\" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[List of Fantastic Four enemies|foe]] of the [[Fantastic Four]].  His first appearance was in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #359 (December, 1991); he was created by Tom DeFalco, Paul Ryan and Danny Bulanadi.

==Fictional character biography==
Devos is an extraterrestrial vigilante dedicated to bringing peace to the universe, but holds the rather warped view that this can only be done by destroying anyone whom he deems a threat to galactic peace\u2014therefore, killing everyone capable of waging war. While Devos is willing to make alliances with other villains in order to further his goals, he inevitably betrays his allies (as they too are capable of waging war).

In his first appearance, he battled the [[Fantastic Four]], then fled in his escape craft while his starship was destroyed.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #359</ref> He then encountered and joined forces with [[Paibok]] the Power Skrull.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #366</ref> He watched Paibok alter [[Lyja]]'s genetic structure, then arrived on Earth with Paibok. He joined Paibok and Lyja the Lazerfist in an attack on the [[Human Torch]] in New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #369-371</ref>

His most notable act is probably his destruction of the [[Skrull]] Throneworld, throwing the [[Skrull]] Empire into [[civil war]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #383 (December 1993)</ref>

Devos later reappears in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' miniseries in the pages of ''[[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]''. On the planet Godthab Omega, he was attacked by Talos the Untamed and later captured by [[Glorian]].<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #2</ref> Devos conferred with Talos, who realized that Glorian was the one-time pupil of the [[Shaper of Worlds]].<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #3</ref> When the planet was overrun by the [[Annihilation Wave]], Glorian was distracted, releasing Devos and Talos. Ronan ordered the two of them to the spaceport to get off-planet with any other survivors.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #4</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Devos wears an armored battlesuit that granted him tremendous strength and physical resistance. The suit is equipped with an energy blaster with automated targeting devices mounted on his right shoulder.<ref>''Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files'' Vol 1 #1 (August 2006)</ref> It can fire projectiles with bazooka force from either shoulder, as well as poison gases or frost grenades via left wrist device and emit powerful [[electric shocks]] inside the outer surface of his armor. His helmet is also equipped with sophisticated internal sensor systems, designed to allow him see into otherwise invisible portions of the spectrum. It contains a \"Luminator\", which produces blinding lights. The [[anti-gravity]] generators in his exoskeleton enables him to fly at subsonic speeds.

===The Arsenal Planet===
Devos has access to numerous space vessels, advanced weaponry, and robotic servants, including Sedators (warrior robots), Servo-bots (robots capable of performing maintenance work aboard Devos's starship), and Bouncer-bots (large humanoid units built to handle and capture specimens for study).<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Vol 1 #3 (July 2008)</ref>
