==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Nathaniel Richards was a successful scientist who specialized in multiple fields. He was married to [[Evelyn Richards|Evelyn]] and together had a son named Reed who possessed an intellectual mind like his father. When Evelyn died, Nathaniel continued to raise his son by supporting his scientific endeavors.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #570</ref> Later, Nathaniel is approached by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (2010 series)|Brotherhood of the Shield]] and joins their group. Along with [[Howard Stark]], the two meet a super powered individual named Leonid and help him resolve a dispute between the time traveling [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who had split the organization in two.

Nathaniel ended up in another dimension where the Earth had become a desolate wasteland when the moon was destroyed.

The [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]] arrived in this dimension, defeated Cassandra and freed Nathaniel. After father and son had a heartfelt reunion, Nathaniel stayed behind to help rebuild.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #272\u2013273</ref>

However, Nathaniel arrived in the present to kidnap [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #376</ref> Nathaniel aged Franklin to a teenager in an effort to prevent Franklin from having a child with [[Rachel Summers]].

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Universe]], Reed's father is renamed '''Gary Richards''' and he does not have a scientific background. He also seems to despise his son's scientific mind, preferring his friend Ben Grimm's athletic abilities. When the [[Baxter Building]] think tank accepted Reed, Gary was glad that he was gone.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> When [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]] kidnapped Reed's younger sister Enid, Gary went to Reed for help though he still resented him.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #42</ref> When Reed quit the Fantastic Four, Gary was there to greet him, not acting surprised.<ref>''Ultimatum Fantastic Four: Requiem''</ref> Gary, along with his wife Mary and two daughters, were killed in an explosion directed at the Richards household, later revealed to have been perpetrated by Reed himself, now the [[supervillain]]ous [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]].<ref>''Ultimate Enemy'' #1</ref>

==In other media==
Reed's father, simply credited as '''Mr. Richards''', appears in 2015's ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' played by [[Tim Heidecker]].
