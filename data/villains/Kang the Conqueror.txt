'''Kang the Conqueror''' ('''Nathaniel Richards''') is a <!--Do not add \"fictional\" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is most frequently depicted as an opponent of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. A time-traveling entity and descendant of the [[Nathaniel Richards (Marvel Comics)|scientist of the same name]], several alternate versions of Kang have appeared throughout Marvel Comics titles over the years, including his respective future and past heroic selves, [[Pharaoh Rama-Tut]], [[Immortus]], the [[Scarlet Centurion]], [[#Victorex Prime|Victorex Prime]], [[Victor Timely]], [[Iron Lad]], [[#Chronomonitor #616|Chronomonitor #616]], and [[#Mister Gryphon|Qeng Gryphon]]. Other characters to assume the title of \"Kang\" include Kang's sons Marcus and [[Ahura Boltagon]], his wives [[Ravonna]], [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], and [[Nebula (character)|Nebula]], as well as alternate versions of [[Alternate versions of Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]] and [[Kamala Khan]].

He made his feature film debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]'' (2023), portrayed by [[Jonathan Majors]], who also portrayed Pharaoh Rama-Tut, Victor Timely, Immortus, [[Scarlet Centurion]], Chronomonitor #616, and the wider Council of Kangs in the film's [[mid-credits scene]], and will reprise the roles in ''[[Avengers: The Kang Dynasty]]'' (2025) and ''[[Avengers: Secret Wars]]'' (2026). Majors also previously appeared as \"[[He Who Remains (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|He Who Remains]]\", a version of the character from the previous incarnation of [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] and creator of the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), in the episode \"[[For All Time. Always.]]\" from the 2021 [[Loki (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'', and will return as Victor Timely in the series' 2023 [[Loki (season 2)|second season]].

==Publication history==
The character who would become best known as Kang first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #19 (October 1963), by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. This issue introduced the pharaoh Rama-Tut, a criminal from the year 3000 who had travelled back in time and conquered ancient Egypt, and who was implied to be a descendant (or possibly future incarnation) of Fantastic Four villain [[Doctor Doom]]. After a second appearance the following year in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2 (September 1964), the character appeared again in ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #8 (published the same month), also by Lee and Kirby, which revealed that Rama-Tut had gone on to travel to the year 4000, where he had adopted the identity of Kang. A decade later, the character of [[Immortus]], previously introduced in ''Avengers'' #10 (November 1964), was retroactively established to be a future identity of Kang's in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #3 (February 1975). After further being retroactively established to be a direct descendant of [[Reed Richards]]' father [[Nathaniel Richards (Marvel Comics)|Nathaniel]] (via one of Reed's many half-siblings) in ''Fantastic Four'' #272 (November 1984), Kang's birth name was revealed to also be \"Nathaniel Richards\" in ''[[What If (comics)#Volume 2|What If\u2026?]]'' Vol. 2 #39 (July 1992), a fact later incorporated into the primary continuity of the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Kang===
'''Nathaniel Richards''', a 31st-century scholar and descendant of [[Reed Richards]]' time traveling father [[Nathaniel Richards (Marvel Comics)|Nathaniel]], becomes fascinated with history and discovers the time travel technology created by [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]], another possible ancestor of his.<ref>Mentioned in ''The Avengers'' #11 (Dec. 1964). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #273. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> He then travels back in time to ancient [[Egypt]] aboard a Sphinx-shaped timeship and becomes the '''Pharaoh Rama-Tut''' (while a variant of him is simultaneously recruited by the [[Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) as '''Chronomonitor #616'''), with plans to claim En Sabah Nur\u2014the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] destined to become [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]\u2014as his heir.<ref>''The Rise of Apocalypse'' #1\u20134 (Oct. 1996 \u2013 Jan. 1997). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> The pharaoh's rule is cut short when he is defeated by the time-displaced [[Fantastic Four]].<ref name=\"FF4\">''Fantastic Four'' #19 (Sep. 1963). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> An embittered Nathaniel Richards travels forward to the 20th century where he meets [[Doctor Doom]], whom he believes might be his ancestor.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #2</ref> He later designs an armor based on Doom's and, calling himself the '''Scarlet Centurion''', pits the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] team against alternate-reality counterparts. He plans to dispose of all of them, but the Avengers manage to force him from the timeline,<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #2 (September 1968). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> where a divergent version of him becomes '''Victorex Prime''', [[archenemy]] of the [[Squadron Supreme]].<ref>''[[Squadron Supreme]]'' #2 (October 1985). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Nathaniel then tries to return to the 31st century, but overshoots by a thousand years, discovering a war-torn Earth that uses advanced weapons they no longer understand. He finds it simple to conquer the planet, expanding his dominion throughout the galaxy, and reinvents himself as '''Kang the Conqueror'''. But this future world is dying, and so he decides to take over an earlier, more fertile Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=101}}</ref><ref name=\"aven8\">''Avengers'' #8 (Sep. 1964). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Early appearances and Ravonna===
On Nathaniel's first foray into the 20th century under the Kang identity, he meets and battles the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], capturing everyone but the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and informs the world that they have 24 hours to surrender to him. Jones and some friends pretend they want to help Kang, but double-cross him once they gain access to his ship, and the Avengers are freed. In an attempt to stop them, Kang releases radiation that only beings from his time are immune to, but Thor uses his hammer to absorb the rays and send them back at the warlord so even he cannot withstand it, and he is forced to escape.<ref name=\"aven8\"/> He later attempts to defeat the Avengers using a [[Spider-Man]] robot, but the real Spider-Man destroys it.<ref>''The Avengers'' #11 (Dec. 1964). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In his own time, Kang falls for the princess of one of his subject kingdoms, [[Ravonna]], who does not return his feelings. In an attempt to demonstrate his power, he kidnaps the Avengers and, after several escape attempts on their part, subdues them and the rebellious kingdom with the help of his army. When Kang refuses to execute Ravonna, his commanders revolt and he frees the Avengers to fight with him against them. They successfully subdue them, but not before Ravonna is mortally wounded when she leaps in front of a blast meant for Kang, realizing she does love him after all. Kang returns the Avengers to their present,<ref>''The Avengers'' #23\u201324 (Dec. 1965\u2013Jan. 1966). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> and places Ravonna's body in stasis.

Kang appears in modern-day as he attempts to retrieve a rogue Growing Man construct who is growing larger with every blow. Both Thor and the police are not able to subdue the giant, until Kang appears from a time machine disguised as a boulder. He fires a ray, shrinking and subduing the Growing Man to doll-sized so he can be \"re-hidden\".<ref>''Thor'' #140. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> He later reactivates the Growing Man to kidnap an incapacitated Tony Stark and draw the Avengers into his game, though the purpose isn't revealed. Thor fails to keep Kang from escaping into the time-stream.<ref>''The Avengers'' #69. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In hopes of restoring his love to life, Kang enters a wager with the cosmic entity [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], using the Avengers as pawns in a game which, if won, can temporarily grant him power over life and death.<ref>''The Avengers'' #69\u201371 (Oct. 1969\u2013Dec. 1969). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> The first round ends in stalemate when an unaware [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] intervenes and prevents a clear victory by the Avengers, although the team definitively wins the second round. Due to the first round's stalemate, Kang does not earn the power of both life and death but is forced to choose. He selects the power of death over the Avengers, but is stopped by the Black Knight, who, not being an Avenger at the time, is unaffected.<ref>''The Avengers'' #71 (Dec. 1969). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Next Kang kidnaps the Hulk and sends him to 1917 France to kill the [[Phantom Eagle]] before he can destroy a giant German cannon which would otherwise kill Banner's grandfather who is fighting in the trenches. This would prevent the Hulk from existing and consequently, the formation of the Avengers. However, the Hulk destroys the cannon which sends him back to the present while Kang is projected into the Limbo.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #135 (Jan. 1971). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===The Celestial Madonna===
Some time later Kang reappears at Avengers Mansion seeking the \"Celestial Madonna\", who turns out to be [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], desiring to marry her as she is apparently destined to have a powerful child. The heroes are aided by a future version of Kang, who, tired of conquest, had returned to ancient Egypt and his identity of Rama-Tut, ruling benevolently for ten years before placing himself in suspended animation to revive in the 20th century, desiring to counsel and change his younger self. While Kang is successfully foiled, Rama-Tut is unable to prevent the accidental death of the Avenger the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]].<ref name=\"Celestial Madonna\">''The Avengers'' #129 and ''Avengers Giant-Size'' #2 (Nov. 1974). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> During an adventure in Limbo, it is revealed that [[Immortus]] is the future incarnation of both Kang and Rama-Tut.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #3 (Feb. 1975). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

While attempting to travel to the time of the Crusades, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] accidentally comes across Kang, sending both to the Old West. The warlord begins to develop a stronghold to conquer the 19th century, thus also conquering the present. Aided this time by Immortus, the Avengers, with some assistance from the [[Two-Gun Kid]], confront Kang. While trying to muster the strength to defeat Thor, Kang overloads his armor and destroys himself, apparently erasing Immortus and Rama-Tut from existence.<ref>''The Avengers'' #141\u2013143 (Nov. 1975\u2013Jan. 1976). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Prime Kang and creation of alternate selves===
Years later, the [[Beyonder]] plucks a living Kang from the timestream to participate on the villains' side in the first of the [[Secret Wars]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1\u201312 (May 1984 \u2013 April 1985). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Soon after, it is revealed that while Kang had indeed died, his constant time-traveling had created a number of alternate Kangs. The Kang to discover this had been drawn to Limbo after his time-travel vehicle was destroyed by Thor. Finding Immortus' remains inside his fortress, Kang assumes the \"Lord of Time\" to be deceased and discovers the alternate versions of himself using viewing devices he finds, although he does not realize that Immortus is also a version of himself. At one point, he brings Ravonna to Limbo from the moment before her death, unintentionally creating an alternate reality where he was slain. Determined to be the only Kang, he joins with two particularly cunning divergents whom he determines he cannot easily eliminate, the three forming a council that systematically destroys the other alternate versions. He destroys one of the other two Kangs, then brings in the Avengers as part of a plot to destroy the other one, although the latter Kang eventually discovers the plot. This Kang is delayed by Ravonna, who tells him that if he truly loves her he must not kill the first Kang, but he ignores her, goes after him anyway, and is destroyed. Immortus then reveals he faked his death and manipulated everything from behind the scenes. Now only the one \"Prime\" Kang remains, who Immortus tricks into absorbing the memories of all the slain Kangs, which drives him insane. Immortus then sends the Avengers back to their own timeline.<ref>''The Avengers'' #267\u2013269 (May\u2013July 1986). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

This Kang diverges into two alternate Kangs,<ref name=\"forever9\">''Avengers Forever'' #9. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> and one is invited to join the Crosstime Kang Corps (or the \"Council of Cross-Time Kangs\"), which consists of a wide range of Kangs from multiple timelines who are searching for a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] \"Ultimate Weapon\". This Kang calls himself \"Fred\" (by his own admission a humorous nod to [[Fred Flintstone]], with a prehistoric name being appropriate for a time-traveler) and has a brief encounter with the Avengers while trying to stop the space pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] from interfering with a timeline.<ref name=\"Council\">''The Avengers'' #291\u2013297 (May\u2013Nov. 1988). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> The '''Prime Kang''', having recovered, then attempts to manipulate the Avengers from a time vortex,<ref>''The Avengers'' #300 (Feb. 1989). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> and encounters the Fantastic Four in a bid to capture Mantis and use her to defeat a Celestial and the other Kangs,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #323\u2013325 (Feb.\u2013Apr. 1989). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> while \"Fred\" is incinerated by a Nebula-possessed [[Human Torch]] during a later battle with the Fantastic Four in the timestream.<ref name=\"Incinerated\">''Fantastic Four'' #337\u2013341 (Feb.\u2013June 1990). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===New Empire, ''Avengers Forever'', and ''Young Avengers''===
Later, the Prime Kang appears, captures the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and battles both the Avengers and a new foe, Terminatrix, who is revealed to be a revived Ravonna. Kang is critically injured when he intercepts a blow from Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] that was meant for his old love, who is distraught over his sacrifice and teleports away with him.<ref>''Captain America'' Annual #11; ''Thor'' Annual #17; ''Fantastic Four'' Annual #26 and ''The Avengers'' Annual #21 (1992). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Terminatrix places Prime Kang in stasis to heal his injuries and assumes control of his empire. However, she finds the empire under attack by a chronal being called '''Alioth''', and is forced to summon the Avengers to assist. She revives Kang, who assists the Avengers in defeating Alioth, but not before allowing the entity to kill the entire Crosstime Kang Corps.<ref>''The Terminatrix Objective'' #1\u20134 (Sep.\u2013Dec. 1993). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', flashbacks reveal that many of Kang's recent actions were motivated by more of a desire to do something rather than a genuine desire for power, and that Rama-Tut is his past and future self, feeling listless and trapped by the burdens of the empire he has created. However, as Kang prepares to become Rama-Tut once again and from there [[Immortus]], he glimpses the future and learns of Immortus's servitude to the [[Time-Keepers]] of the [[Time Variance Authority]], renewing his horror at the destiny that awaits him as that 'simpering academic'.<ref name=\"forever9\"/> As a result, Kang rejects this future to the point of aiding the Avengers in protecting [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] from Immortus's latest scheme.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> When Immortus betrays the Time Keepers to try and save the Avengers, they kill him and attempt to turn Kang into Immortus before Rama-Tut became Immortus. However, the temporal backlash of Kang's strength of will in a temporally unstable environment causes Immortus and Rama-Tut to split off from Kang, essentially making them  both clear alternate versions of Kang rather than Kang's definitive future. With the weakened Time Keepers destroyed, Kang rejoices in his freedom from the destiny of Immortus and Rama-Tut, as he has now technically become them while still being himself.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #12. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

After some months, Kang embarks on an [[Kang Dynasty|ambitious scheme]] to conquer the Earth, this time aided by his son Marcus, who uses the \"Scarlet Centurion\" alias. Kang promises any who aid him on Earth a place in his new order, which puts Earth's defenses and the Avengers under strain as they fight off villain after villain. He then takes control of Earth's defense systems, and forces a surrender after destroying [[Washington, D.C.]], killing millions. The Avengers continue to battle the forces of Kang's new empire, and Captain America eventually defeats him in personal combat. Although imprisoned, Kang is freed by his son, revealed to be only one of a series of clones, and kills clone Marcus for betraying him by assisting [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] during the invasion and keeping it secret despite multiple opportunities to admit the truth; while Kang could tolerate the treachery if it allowed Marcus to become his own man, he cannot tolerate a traitor who remains active in his ranks. Depressed at his new loss, Kang retreats from Earth.<ref>''The Avengers'' #41\u201355 (Jun. 2001\u2013Aug. 2002); ''The Avengers Annual'' 2001. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

At some point, Kang travels back to his own past to prevent an incident where a confrontation with a bully left him in a coma for a year, but meeting his future self so horrifies Kang's past self that he steals Kang's armor and retreats to the past, using an emergency protocol created by the Vision to recruit a new team that come to be known as the '[[Young Avengers]]', with the young Kang adopting the alias of '[[Iron Lad]]'. When Kang tracks his younger self to the past, the Young Avengers are able to kill him, but the subsequent changes to history force the young Kang to return to his time and erase his memory of these events, although the Young Avengers remain as a team with Iron Lad's armor now self-operating with a consciousness based on an amalgamation of Iron Lad and the Vision.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #1-6. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Kang travels the multi-verse and recruits [[Stryfe]], [[Earth-X]] [[Venom (character)|Venom]] ([[May \"Mayday\" Parker]]), [[Doom 2099]], [[Iron Man 2020]], [[Ahab (comics)|Ahab]], Magistrate Braddock, and Abomination Deathlok to save the multi-verse and possibly restore the universes that have already been erased.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #14. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> He appears to the remaining members of the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]] after Earth has been destroyed by a Celestial leaving only the mutants. Temporal barriers prevent Kang simply travelling back himself, but he is able to help the surviving Unity Squad members project their minds back into their past selves so that they can defeat the Celestial that attacked Earth.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #19. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Kang subsequently attempts to steal the Celestials' power for himself,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #21. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> requiring [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and Havok to put themselves at risk by absorbing some of his energy themselves so that they can force him to expend his stolen power.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #22. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===''Uncanny Inhumans'' and All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Before the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] king [[Black Bolt]] destroys the city of Attilan to release [[Terrigen Mist]] throughout the world, he sends his son [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]] away for Kang to foster. Black Bolt later releases a small amount of Terrigen Mist to activate Ahura's terrigenesis and activate his Inhuman ability. While Ahura is going through the change, Black Bolt asks Kang to save his son from the coming [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|end of all things]], which Kang agrees to on the condition that the son remain permanently in his care.<ref>''[[Uncanny Inhumans|The Uncanny Inhumans]]'' #0. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

While taunting the Inhumans' efforts to find Ahura,<ref>''The Uncanny Inhumans'' #1. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> another Kang emerges under the alias of \"{{anchor|Mister Gryphon|Mr. Gryphon}}Mister Gryphon\", claiming that he has become splintered into various alternate versions of himself as a result of recent temporal disruptions. With this Kang confined to the present, he mounts a massive assault on the Avengers with the aid of [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]] and a reprogrammed Vision, intending to use [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]'s time-traveling ability to return to his era, but is defeated.<ref name=\"All-New All-Different Avengers #6\">''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

When Vision abducts Kang's infant self in an attempt to defeat him, the latter, split into increasingly divergent versions of himself by the fractured state of time, retaliates by attacking various Avengers in their infant states. A possible future version of Kang saves key Avengers from his past self's attack by bringing them into Limbo until Hercules acquires an amulet from a former Fate that protects him from Kang's assault. During a battle inside a temple in [[Vietnam]], the Wasp goes to place baby Kang back where he belongs. Kang is subsequently defeated.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 7 #1\u20136 (2016). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

During the \"[[Infinity Countdown]]\" storyline, Kang the Conqueror gains knowledge of the calamity that would come if the [[Infinity Gems]] were to be gathered in the same location again. To prevent this from occurring, he abducts Adam Warlock, convinces him to help secure the Soul Gem in exchange for the Time Gem, and sends him back in time to receive counsel from Kang's Rama-Tut counterpart.<ref>''Infinity Countdown: Adam Warlock'' #1. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Fresh start and ''Kang the Conqueror'' solo series===
Kang the Conqueror has most recently been seen as a recurring character in the \"Pottersville\" arc of the ''[[Doctor Doom]]'' solo series, in which he is shown to be tethered to Doom in a quantum entanglement, appearing at random times throughout the series conversing with the Latverian despot.<ref>''Doctor Doom'' #1. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> This is later revealed to be a ploy by Kang, as by aiding Doom in saving the world Kang is actually making the world easier for himself to conquer in two hundred years' time.<ref>''Doctor Doom'' #5. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> In the solo series ''[[Kang the Conqueror (comic book)|Kang the Conqueror]]'', Kang rewrites history by manipulating a younger version of him to go through all of his previous identities \u2013 Iron Lad, Scarlet Centurion, Pharaoh Rama-Tut, and finally Kang \u2013 into becoming the purest form of would-be conqueror, resurrecting [[Ravonna]] by giving her the ability of [[reincarnation]].<ref>''[[Kang the Conqueror (comic book)|Kang the Conqueror]]'' #1 (August 18, 2021). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kang has no superhuman abilities but is an extraordinary genius, an expert historical scholar, and a master physicist (specializing in time travel), engineer, and technician. He is armed with 40th-century technology, wearing highly advanced battle armor that enhances his strength, is capable of energy, hologram, and force-field projection, has a 30-day supply of air and food, and is capable of controlling other forms of technology. Courtesy of his \"[[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Kang's Time-Ship|time-ship]]\", Kang has access to technology from any century, and he once claimed his ship alone could destroy the [[Moon]].<ref name=\"aven8\"/>

As Rama-Tut, he used an \"ultra-diode\" ray gun that was able to sap the wills of human beings. At a high frequency, it is able to weaken superhuman beings and prevent use of their superpowers. They can be freed from its effects if the gun is fired at them a second time.

==Variations==
There are different variations of Kang the Conqueror:

===Pharaoh Rama-Tut{{anchor|Rama-Tut}}===
'''Pharaoh Rama-Tut''' was Kang's original alias when he ruled ancient Egypt.<ref name=\"FF4\"/> Later in life, he retires as Kang and returns to the Pharaoh Rama-Tut identity, and helps the Avengers defeat his past self when he attempts to capture the \"Celestial Madonna\".<ref name=\"Celestial Madonna\"/> He nearly surrenders to destiny to become Immortus, but changes his mind and returns to the Kang identity when he discovers that Immortus is a pawn of beings called the Time-Keepers.<ref name=\"forever9\"/>

===Immortus===
{{main|Immortus}}
'''Immortus''' is an alternate version of Kang who resides in Limbo. Kang was destined to become him until the last issue of the ''Avengers Forever'' series, in which powerful beings called the Time Keepers unintentionally separate the former from the latter.

===Iron Lad===
{{main|Iron Lad}}
'''Iron Lad''' is an adolescent version of Kang who learned of his future self when Kang tried to prevent a childhood hospitalization. Attempting to escape his destiny, the teen Nate Richards steals his future self's advanced armor and travels back to the past, forming the [[Young Avengers]] to help him stop Kang. When his attempt to reject his destiny results in Kang's death, the resulting destruction caused by the changes in history forces Iron Lad to return to his time and undo the damage by becoming Kang.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #1\u20136 (2006). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Victor Timely===
{{main|Victor Timely}}
A divergent version of Kang establishes a small, quiet town called Timely, [[Wisconsin]] in 1901 to serve as a 20th-century base, where he occasionally resides as '''[[Mayor]] Victor Timely'''. Posing as his own son '''Victor Timely Jr.''', he develops an interest in a visiting college graduate named [[Phineas Horton]], providing the young man with insights which eventually led to his creating the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]].<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #21 (January 1992). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Scarlet Centurion===
Numerous versions/relatives of Kang have assumed this alias, typically with a penchant for [[Battle royal|death games]] (setting teams of heroes against one another):
* '''Nathaniel Richards the Second''', in a one-time identity he assumed after being the Pharaoh Rama-Tut but before going on to become Kang.<ref>''What If?'' #29. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>
* '''Marcus Kang''' aka '''Marcus XXIII''', the son of Kang the Conqueror who was active during ''[[Avengers Forever]]''.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #38. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>
* A version of Kang who remained the Scarlet Centurion and conquered the alternate universe [[Earth-712]].<ref>''The Avengers Annual'' #2. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Victorex Prime{{anchor|Squadron Supreme}}===
'''Victorex Prime''' is a divergent version of the Scarlet Centurion who retained the identity and never became Kang, instead taking over the future of the [[Squadron Supreme#Earth-712 version|Squadron Supreme]]'s universe of [[Earth-712]], in the 40th century.<ref name=\"forever9\"/><ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (1985). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> On becoming bored with his success and dictatorship over a total of fifteen moons and planets, Victorex Prime elects to invade the past for further conquests, coming into conflict with the [[Squadron Supreme]] by sending \"temporal hard light holograms\" of his Scarlet Centurion form to the past to fight on his behalf, and bringing a number of the team to his time in order to compete in [[Battle royal|death games]], serving as the champions of the [[Earth-616]] [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] against Victorex Prime's own [[Institute of Evil]]. On losing, Victorex Prime inadvertently inspires the Grandmaster to issue similar challenges to other divergent versions of Kang.<ref name=\":SS9\">''[[Squadron Supreme]]'' #9 (May 1986). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

While arranging for his fourth invasion into the past, sending a holographic envoy of his Scarlet Centurion form ahead of him as herald, Victorex Prime is left shaken when [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], \"not in the mood\" for battle, while mourning a loss, informs him that while he has been allowed to live on his previous defeats, he will be executed if he attempts to invade the past when any members of the team are mourning as per the historical record, and that he would slowly kill Victorex Prime personally should he break these rules. Daunted, Victorex Prime flees to the future, resorting to subtle ways to mess with the Squadron by interfering with [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]]'s attempts to develop a [[cure for cancer]] (and all other diseases, as well as [[ageing]]), before succumbing to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], having conquered everything in the past, present, and future, after a temporal bubble emerges around the late 20th century and surrounding decades, preventing him from visiting the time.<ref name=\":SS9\" />

Thirty-five years later, still unchallenged and unfulfilled, Victorex Prime's followers discover a crack in the temporal bubble, displaying [[Nth Man|a massive humanoid hand]] emerging from space and growing large enough to engulf the Earth, the Sun, and all of space itself. Emboldened by this new challenge, and once again able to access the past, Victorex Prime sends a new temporal hologram backwards in time to confer with the [[Master Menace]], the greatest criminal scientist of his age, simultaneously with Hyperion seeking out the scientist. Reached a reluctant truce, the Master Menace conceives of a device for Hyperion to use stop the entity's spread over the next ten hours, while Victorex Prime transports Master Menace to his future, where he spends fifteen years perfecting his work before returning the completed device to Hyperion less than an hour after leaving. Holographically accompanying Master Menace and the Squadron Supreme as they journey into space to confront the entity, Victorex Prime realises he enjoys the excitement of being a [[superhero]] instead of a [[supervillain]], and holographically accompanies Master Menace and the Squadron Supreme as they journeyed out into space to confront the entity.<ref name=\"DOU\" />

However, on calculating the present is diverging from his own future, and seeking to preserve his former foes on the failure of Master Menace's device, Victorex Prime retrieves the all-powerful telepath known as [[Overmind (comics)|the Overmind]], believing his power could turn back the entity. After Overmind instead has his head exploded, a terrified Victorex Prime dejectedly admits defeat, and prepares to flee to his future. At the last moment, [[Moonglow (comics)|Arcanna Jones]] begs Victorex Prime to save the life of her infant son, Benjamin Thomas Jones, which after a moment of consideration, Victorex Prime refuses. With the crack in the temporal bubble sealing shut after returning to the 40th century. Immediately regretting his decision, and unaware of the Squadron's fates, Victorex Prime spends the remaining 211 years of his life in abject misery, unaware that the Squadron survived, because of his decision to leave Benjammin behind (who swapped fates with the entity and reversed its annihilation across [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiple universes]]), and deeming the day he left the Squadron behind to die as \"the key moment\" that he \"lost his nerve\", living on in the shame of retreat rather than facing the unknown alongside the worthiest of former foes, and eventually dying of old age, unfulfilled, without the knowledge he coveted most in the world.<ref name=\"DOU\">''[[Squadron Supreme|Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe]]'' (October 1989). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===Chronomonitor #616===
'''Chronomonitor #616''' is a variation of Kang the Conqueror who works for the [[Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), inducted into the organization on his first attempt to travel back in time. A renegade [[Chronomonitor]] from the organization, he is stripped of his power after interfering with history for personal gain as part of a [[mid-life crisis]] before escaping custody and killing and replacing a version of himself as Rama-Tut. Ultimately, Chronomonitor #616 is trapped in a [[time loop]] by the TVA, swearing revenge upon them and the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|''Marvel Adventures Fantastic Four'']] #23 (August [[2007 in comics|2007]]).

He is an [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] [[Businessperson|businessman]] and the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Qeng Enterprises.<ref name=\"All-New All-Different Avengers #6\"/>

===Crosstime Kang Corps{{anchor|Council of Cross-Time Kangs}}===
Numerous versions/successor of Kang form the members of this organization, also known as the Council of Cross-Time Kangs:

* '''Frederick''' \"'''Fred'''\" '''Kang''', who named himself after the cartoon character [[Fred Flintstone]].<ref name=\"forever9\"/> He is later incinerated by a Nebula-possessed [[Human Torch]].<ref name=\"Incinerated\" />

Introduced in the episode \"Meet Captain America\", Kang's timeline is retroactively erased from existence due to a temporal anomaly, which leaves his lover Princess [[Ravonna]] in a coma.

In the episode \"New Avengers\", the Council of Kangs frees the original Kang from prison and provides him with new armor, which he uses to take over [[Stark Tower]] so he can use its arc reactor to bring his citadel to the 21st century, incidentally causing \"time ripples\" across New York and scattering the Avengers across time. In response, the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] Protocol is activated and [[Spider-Man]], [[War Machine]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]], [[Luke Cage]], and [[Iron Fist (character)|Iron Fist]] join forces to defeat Kang, casting him out of the timestream and returning the original Avengers to the present while [[S.W.O.R.D.
