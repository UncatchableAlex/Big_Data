==Fictional character history==
Barney Barton was born in Waverly, Iowa.

He suggested that Clint should join him and make a fresh start. Clint declined his offer. Barney told his brother that the offer still stood, and he would wait for him if he changed his mind. The next morning, Barney stood at the bus depot, waiting and hoping his brother would change his mind. When Clint did not show up, a sorrowful Barney got on the bus and left his old life behind. As the bus was departing, Clint arrived, having changed his mind. However, he was too late.<ref name=\"hawkeyev34\">''[[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'' (vol. 3) #4 (March 2004)</ref>

Barney later became an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2021-12-01 |title=Hawkeye's 10 Best Relationships In Marvel Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/hawkeye-best-relationships-in-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Raymond |first=Charles Nicholas |date=2020-08-28 |title=How Hawkeye Can Get A Proper MCU Origin Story On Disney+ |url=https://screenrant.com/hawkeye-show-disney-plus-origin-story-mcu-possibility/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> His first assignment was to work undercover as a bodyguard for a criminal called Marko.<ref name=\"hawkeyev36\">''Hawkeye'' (vol. 3) #6 (May 2004)</ref> Unbeknownst to him, Clint and his new mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] attempted to rob the criminal's mansion.

Trick Shot wounded Clint with an arrow and left.<ref name=\"hawkeyev35\">''Hawkeye'' (vol. 3) #5 (Apr. 2004)</ref>

His next undercover assignment was to pose as a racketeer. He was approached by [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], who offered Barney a place on his villainous space-station in exchange for funds. When Barney declined the offer, Egghead (actually a robot sent by the real Egghead) attacked him. With his bodyguards slain, Barney went to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (whose ranks included his brother, now using the identity of Goliath) to help stop the supervillain. Barney and the Avengers battled Egghead and his robot soldiers inside the villain's space-station. During the battle, Barney sacrificed his life to destroy Egghead's deadly ray-projector.<ref name=\"avengers64\">''The Avengers'' #64 (May 1969)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Ant-Man and the Wasp' Featured a Classic Ant-Man Enemy Cameo |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/ant-man-and-the-wasp-easter-eggs-egghead/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref> After the funeral, Clint received a letter from FBI agent Allan Scofield revealing Barney's double life.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Francisco |first=Mikael Angelo |date=2021-09-22 |title=The Untold Truth of Hawkeye - Looper |url=https://www.looper.com/612480/the-untold-truth-of-hawkeye/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The letter also revealed that Barney was aware of Clint's double life.<ref name=\"hawkeyev36\"/>

Unbeknownst to both Hawkeye and the Avengers, Barney's corpse was stolen by Egghead. Egghead discovered that Barney was still displaying faint vital signs and placed him in a healing chamber.<ref name=\"hawkeyebs3\">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #3 (June 2011)</ref> Later, Egghead was inadvertently killed by Hawkeye in a battle with the Avengers, leaving Barney suspended in the healing chamber and forgotten.<ref name=\"avengers228229\">''The Avengers'' #228\u2013229 (February\u2013March 1983)</ref> He was later discovered by Baron [[Helmut Zemo]].

Once the training was completed, Trick Shot was badly beaten and his cancer was allowed to fester. Barney then delivered the dying Trick Shot to [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] as a message to Hawkeye.<ref name=\"hawkeyebs1\"/> Later, while investigating his former mentor's death, Hawkeye was ambushed by his brother.<ref name=\"hawkeyebs2\">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2 (May 2011)</ref> Declaring himself as the new \"Trickshot\", Barney subdued Hawkeye and delivered him to Baron Zemo.<ref name=\"hawkeyebs3\"/> Zemo had the brothers duel to the death. Hawkeye (despite going blind from a previous injury with the third [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]) managed to best Barney in battle. Before teleporting away, Zemo transferred Barney's criminal funds over to the \"victor\" Hawkeye, then taunted the hero for turning his brother against him. In custody, Barney agreed to a bone marrow transplant to save his brother's sight, but only so he could battle Hawkeye again in the future.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #4 (July 2011)</ref><ref name=\"Avina\">{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2019-11-13 |title=Marvel: 15 Best Hawkeye Villains, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-hawkeye-best-villains-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Brenton Stewart of ''[[CBR.com]]'' stated, \"Trickshot's love/hate relationship with Hawkeye defined much of his appearances in the comics. He later appeared as a member of a Dark Avengers team where his insecurities over his unfavorable comparison to his brother dominated his character, and ultimately, that is exactly what gets at the heart of what is great about the character. It's hard enough for the world to spare much love for the world's greatest archer, but the world's ''second'' greatest archer gets even less. But what already works so well in the comics would work even better in the MCU where Trickshot could truly shine.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stewart |first=Brenton |date=2021-12-29 |title=Hawkeye's Arch-Nemesis Would Be PERFECT for a Disney+ Sequel |url=https://www.cbr.com/hawkeye-trickshot-would-be-perfect-for-sequel/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Jordan Iacobucci of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' wrote, \"If the MCU intends on adapting the ''Dark Avengers'' storyline with its Thunderbolts, Barney Barton is an excellent choice, as his addition could both enliven Clint Barton's character arc, as well as inform a potential second season of ''Hawkeye'', which is rumored to be in development. The character is one major piece of Clint's story yet to be adapted for the MCU, who should reunite with his brother before Jeremy Renner's inevitable exit from the franchise.\"<ref name=\"Iacobucci\">{{Cite web |last=Iacobucci |first=Jordan |date=2022-06-13 |title=10 Comic Book Thunderbolts That Should Join The MCU Team |url=https://screenrant.com/thunderbolts-comic-book-join-mcu-team/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>
