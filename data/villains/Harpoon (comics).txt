Harpoon was one of the members of the original incarnation of the Marauders, assembled by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].<ref>''X-Men Origins: Gambit'' (one-shot). W: Mike Carey. A: David Yardin.</ref><ref>''Uncany X-Men'' #350.</ref>{{efn|In ''X-Men Origins: Gambit'', it is shown on panel Gambit recruiting the original members (save Harpoon), then a double page spread where he is present.}} The team ambush a Morlock girl named Tommy and a human Hellfire Club soldier called Richard in Los Angeles. They let the girl escape to the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]' Alley, while they kill Richard.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #210.</ref>{{efn|In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #210, Harpoon appears as a silhouette.}}{{efn|Although it was initially established that the Marauders followed Tommy to the Alley, later retcons show that Gambit lead them down in the tunnels.}}

In the first encounter with the X-Men during the [[Mutant Massacre|Morlock Massacre]], Harpoon hurls a harpoon at [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] while she is vulnerable after having her powers neutralized by the Marauder Scrambler. Kitty phases Rogue hoping Harpoon's weapon will pass harmlessly through her, but the spear is in an energy state and strikes them anyway, trapping Kitty Pryde in a ghost-like state.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211.</ref>

In other appearances during the crossover, he crosses paths with Cyclops, Beast and Iceman, and tries to kill a Morlock named Plague with Sabertooth, but they are stopped by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who recruits the woman to his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' (Vol. 1) #10.</ref> He and Blockbuster later attack the X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]. Harpoon pins Angel to the wall, but before he and his Marauder cohorts can slay him, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] intervenes and drives them off.<ref>''X-Factor'' (Vol. 1) #10.</ref><ref>''Thor'' (1966) #373-374.</ref> Harpoon personally kills many, including the young mutant [[Cybelle (comics)|Cybelle]].{{Issue|date=December 2020}}

===Further appearances===
Harpoon is thought to have been slain during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] incident, but as often shown, Mister Sinister can clone his Marauders and bring them back at any time.<ref>''Gambit'' #9.</ref><ref>''X-Force'' (Vol. 3) #9.</ref> Since he continues to be under Mr. Sinister's thrall, Harpoon often works as his enforcer, such as in the capture of the X-Man ([[Nate Grey]]), during the [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught crossover]].<ref>''X-Man'' (1995) #18.</ref>

Harpoon is confirmed to be [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] after the M-Day incident.<ref>''New Avengers'' #18.</ref>

After M-Day, Harpoon resurfaces with the rest of the Marauders, and still working for Mister Sinister.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200-203.</ref> Whether this is one of Sinister's clones has yet to be determined. To make up for his lack of power, he carries a weaponized harpoon, which Storm takes from him and wields herself.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #205.</ref> During the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|final battle on Muir Island]], he is telepathically dispatched by Emma Frost.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200-203.</ref>
