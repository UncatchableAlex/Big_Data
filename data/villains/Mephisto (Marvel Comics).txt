'''Mephisto''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' #3 (December [[1968 in comics|1968]]),<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=238}}</ref> and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]] and based on [[Mephistopheles]] \u2013 a demon character from the [[Faust]] legend, who has sometimes been referred to as Mephisto. Introduced as a recurring adversary of the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], the second incarnation of the [[Ghost Rider]], Mephisto has also endured as one of [[Spider-Man]]'s most prominent adversaries, [[Sinister War|being responsible]] for [[Norman Osborn|Norman]] and [[Harry Osborn]]'s respective transformations into the [[Green Goblin]] and [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]]; and for the superhero's [[Spider-Man: One More Day|loss of his marriage]] to [[Mary-Jane Watson]], considering their future daughter [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] his [[archenemy]]. Mephisto has often come into conflict with [[Doctor Strange]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and other [[Superhero|heroes]] of the [[Marvel Universe]], being responsible both for the creation of the [[Cosmic Ghost Rider]] and the descents of [[Phil Coulson#Marvel Comics|Phil Coulson]] and [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] into [[Supervillain|villainy]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has appeared in over five decades of Marvel continuity. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, feature film, toys, [[trading cards]], and video games.

==Publication history==
Inspired by [[Mephistopheles]] of the [[Goethe's Faust|Faust legend]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Harn|first=Darby|date=2021-02-05|title=10 Things Only Comic Fans Know About Mephisto|url=https://screenrant.com/wandavision-mephisto-most-interesting-comic-book-facts/|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[ScreenRant]]|language=en-US|quote=Mephisto was co-created by legendary Marvel writer and editor-in-chief Stan Lee and equally legendary artist John Buscema. They based the character on Mephistopheles, a demon from the legend of Faust. The character is a surrogate of Hell who more or less plays the same role in the various interpretations of the legend, especially in the historic play Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe and the later play Faust written by the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.}}</ref> he was introduced into Marvel comics by writer [[Stan Lee]] and penciler [[John Buscema]], Mephisto debuted in ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' #3 ([[cover date]]d Dec. 1968),<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2021-02-05 |title=WandaVision: 10 Things Only Comic Fans Know About Mephisto |url=https://screenrant.com/wandavision-mephisto-most-interesting-comic-book-facts/ |access-date=2022-10-31 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> and was established as a perennial foe for the cosmic hero,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=196}}</ref> also appearing in ''Silver Surfer'' #8\u20139 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1969) and 16\u201317 (May \u2013 June 1970).

Author [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] has described Mephisto as \"the [[tempter]] who could offer the endlessly soul-tormented Silver Surfer the world, even dangling the Surfer's off-limits long-distance lover in front of him. As always the case with Lee's heroes, the Surfer's goodness and nobility won out, but Mephisto was only stymied, not defeated, and the pattern was set.\"<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

Mephisto went on to become a foe for the [[Norse god]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in ''Thor'' #180\u2013181 (Sept. \u2013 Oct. 1970), ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #8 (Oct. 1971) and ''Thor'' #204\u2013205 (Oct. \u2013 Nov. 1972). He was later revealed to be the being to whom [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] had sold his soul to and thus had been cursed to become the Ghost Rider,<ref>''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #68 (May 1981)</ref> in a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] that placed him in the role originally played by Satan. This was later retconned back to Satan,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} though Mephisto's influence is still felt in the 1990s by the [[Danny Ketch]] Ghost Rider.

Other appearances included posing as [[Satan]] in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972); tormenting the titular superhero team in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #155\u2013157 (Feb. \u2013 April 1975) and ''Thor'' #310 (Aug. 1981) and 325 (Nov. 1982). Mephisto also guest-starred in two [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]]: ''[[The Vision and the Scarlet Witch]]'' (vol. 2) #1\u201312 (Oct. 1985 \u2013 Sept. 1986) and ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #1-9 (July 1985 \u2013 March 1986), before starring in the self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Mephisto vs.'' #1\u20134 (April \u2013 July 1987), battling four of Marvel's super-teams. The miniseries was penciled by co-creator Buscema.

In ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #266 (May 1989), penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]] redesigned the character, re-imagining him as a bloated, naked creature with short, vaguely frog-like legs and a demonic-looking head. Romita explained, \"I couldn\u2019t see the Devil with tights and a cape.\"<ref name=\"Back21\">{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first= Philippe|date= April 2007|title= Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #21|pages= 33\u201360 |publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Subsequent portrayals have varied between Mephisto's original appearance and the Romita redesign.

Mephisto continued to torment the Scarlet Witch in ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' #51\u201352 (Nov. \u2013 Dec. 1989); created a new adversary for the Marvel heroes in ''Daredevil'' #270 (Sept. 1989); and appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' No. 49 -  ''Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989). Additionally, he was featured prominently in the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'' story line in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544; ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #24; [[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|''The Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2)]] #41 and ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Oct. 2007\u2013Jan. 2008).

In 2009, Mephisto was ranked #48 on [[IGN]]'s list of Greatest Comic Book Villains of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/48.html Mephisto is number 48 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515014329/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/48.html |date=May 15, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Introduction (1960s\u20131970s)===
Mephisto is a perennial villain in the [[Marvel Universe]], and is responsible for a number of evil acts, including capturing and holding the soul of [[Cynthia Von Doom|Cynthia von Doom]] \u2013 the mother of [[Doctor Doom]] \u2014 until [[Doctor Strange]] and Doom freed her so she could ascend into [[Heaven]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #8 (Oct. 1971) and ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' No. 49 - ''Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> He was jealous of the worship of the fire demon [[Zarathos]], so, posing as [[Satan]], Mephisto creates the [[Ghost Rider]] by bonding Zarathos to [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]].<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (Aug. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref> Mephisto refers to his domain as [[Hell]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=216}}</ref> In one story where he battled [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], he was shown to have various historical villains in his realm, such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Blackbeard]], and [[Attila the Hun]].<ref>''Thor'' #205 (Nov. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mephisto claims to have been created, along with many other demons, by the supreme being whose suicide resulted in the creation of the Marvel Universe, as well as the Infinity Gems. He also claimed that his totally evil nature is because the supreme being did not choose to make him good, as that being had no concept of it.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' (vol. 3) #45 (Jan. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> He witnessed the Celestial known as the Progenitor succumbing to the Horde on Earth, with Mephisto, still young in the form of a fly, taking this opportunity to give birth to his maggots.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #38</ref>

===''Secret Wars II'', 1980s and ''The Infinity Gauntlet''===
In ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', Mephisto seeks to steal the [[Beyonder]]'s powers or to destroy him to win the favor of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Mephisto sends an army of supervillains called the Legion Accursed to attack the Beyonder, who is saved by the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]]. After the Legion Accursed was defeated, Mephisto returned its members to where they were before he formed the group.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mephisto later creates his \"son\", [[Blackheart]], a demonic entity that plagues many of Earth's heroes.<ref>''Daredevil'' #270 (Sept. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> Mephisto later manipulates the sorcerer [[Master Pandemonium]] into gathering the five scattered fragments of his soul that were lost in an ill-fated encounter with the aforementioned Franklin Richards.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985)</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= I Sing of Arms and Heroes...| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= #51| date= mid-November 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= Fragments of a Greater Darkness| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= #52| date= December 1989}}</ref> When the [[Scarlet Witch]] attempts to use magic to conceive children with her husband, the android [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], she unknowingly summons two of Pandemonium's soul fragments, which are born as her infant twins. The revelation of her children's origin, followed by their loss when they are reabsorbed into him, drives the Scarlet Witch insane.<ref>''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #1\u201312 (Oct. 1985 \u2013 Sept. 1986) and ''Avengers West Coast'' #51\u201352 (Nov. \u2013 Dec. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mephisto also tries to destroy the Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] when he enters Hell to try to save the soul of his deceased wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 2000''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mephisto acted as a servant of the mad Titan [[Thanos]] during the \"Infinity Wars\", seeking to attain power for himself.

Alongside the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], Blackheart brings [[Wonder Man]] to Mephisto's realm to battle Mephisto.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #22</ref>

In a series of confrontations that also involve the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], the [[Punisher]] and the [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Blackheart kills Mephisto and takes over his portion of Hell.<ref>''Hearts of Darkness'' [graphic novel]</ref><ref>''Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: The Dark Design'' graphic novel</ref> Mephisto survives, although as more of a ghostly apparition (claiming he had been denied a place in both Heaven and Hell), and for a time tricks the [[Silver Surfer]] into believing he was dead so as to collect his soul and thus perhaps regain his former power, but the Surfer refutes him and, with his allies, defeats Mephisto, resulting in his spirit form being seemingly destroyed.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' (vol. 2) #133\u2013137</ref>

Mephisto again survives death and soon finds himself with access to another universe: the Earth of the [[Top Cow Productions|Top Cow]] universe. Seeking to torment an entirely new world of superheroes, he plots to enter this world and remake it for his own dark desires. But [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] senses this cosmic disruption and sends several heroes ([[Jennifer Kale]], the Wolverine, the Ghost Rider, the Silver Surfer and [[Elektra (character)|Elektra]]) to that universe to aid a group of Top Cow heroes ([[Sara Pezzini|Witchblade]], [[Weapon Zero]], [[Cyblade]] and [[Ballistic (Image Comics)|Ballistic]]) to combat and ultimately defeat Mephisto. However, his resulting banishment back to Earth-616 seemed to restore him as a tangible physical threat, though without his elevated place of Hellish power, and he would torment heroes for some years to come, like [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]],<ref>''Nighthawk'' (miniseries) #1\u20133</ref> the [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]],<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 3) #1\u20135</ref> the [[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]],<ref>''Slingers'' #11\u201312</ref> the [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]<ref>''Hellcat'' #1\u20133, ''Thunderbolts Annual 2000''</ref> and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Magik]].<ref>''Magik'' (vol. 2) #1\u20134</ref>

====''One More Day''====
Mephisto heals [[Aunt May|May Parker]] in exchange for changing the personal timelines of Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]) and [[Mary Jane Watson]] so that they never married, claiming he did so only because he hated their happiness (also adding that he has no interest in taking Spider-Man's soul because such a deal would result in him tormenting a soul that is willing to accept the punishment because its sacrifice saved another, a righteousness which disgusts him). He also, at Mary Jane's request, erases all knowledge of Peter's secret identity, both learning only at the point of their memories being erased that their [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|future daughter]] will be erased as well. During the process, [[Harry Osborn]] is also brought back to life;<ref>''One More Day'' \u2014 ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24; ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #41 and ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Oct. 2007\u2013Jan. 2008).

The revolt is quickly put down by the D\u00edsir under Mephisto's command. The D\u00edsir leader Br\u00fcn tries to negotiate with Mephisto because she wishes to invade Hela's realm of Hel and feast on the souls of the Asgardian dead. Mephisto tells her that he has no interest in Hel, but he does not object to their invasion.<ref>''Thor'' #611. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thor, trying to defend Hel and its dead, enters Mephisto's domain to find the Eir-gram, a magical sword that can cut the otherwise insubstantial D\u00edsir. Mephisto offers to give him the Eir-Gram and a \"happily ever after\" for Asgard if he agrees not to interfere with one of Mephisto's plans, which is not at that time named. Thor remains silent the whole time. Mephisto grants him entry to Hell, but Thor must survive many difficulties before he finds the blade.<ref>''Thor'' #612. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Superior Spider-Man asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight the Spider-Man of Earth-44145. While Mephisto states that he either has or does not have his soul, he does have a counteroffer that will restore his body without disease (physical and mental) and the taint of Peter Parker.

Marvel Comics.</ref> It was during this confrontation that Mephisto confesses his true motivations for erasing the marriage of the Parkers, as at some undisclosed point in the future he finally seizes control of Earth, only for his reign to be ended by either Spider-Man or [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|his daughter]]. Striking a deal with Peter to affect his soul and erasing both his marriage with Mary Jane and their daughter was Mephisto's way of ensuring that that future would never come to pass in either scenario. Mephisto is also revealed as the one responsible for the torment and creation of [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|the Kindred Twins]] (the souls of Sarah and Gabriel, clones previously created by a temporarily insane Harry when he was alive and a posthumous A.I. of him to pose as the children of his father and [[Gwen Stacy]], merged with the A.I. in physical demonic forms) as part of his long game waged against Peter Parker and the Osborn family, as well for [[Norman Osborn]]'s initial transformations into the [[Green Goblin]], having long ago made a deal with him in exchange for Harry's soul. [[Doctor Strange]] then strikes a deal with Mephisto to have Harry's soul returned to the body of his clone as the clone is dying, alongside the Kindred Twins.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #74.

====Using the Multiversal Masters of Evil====
At the time when a version of Doctor Doom named [[Doom Supreme]] watched the Prehistoric Avengers send Kid Thanos back to his own time, Mephisto approached Doom Supreme and suggested to him that he put together a team that would defeat any team of Avengers. Doom Supreme took Mephisto's offer and formed a Multiversal version of the [[Masters of Evil]] consisting of a version of Kid Thanos, a version of Dark Phoenix and her pet Berserkers, a version of [[Erik Killmonger]] called [[King Killmonger]], a version of the Green Goblin with Ghost Rider-like powers called the [[Ghost Goblin]], and the [[Black Skull (comics)|Black Skull]]. Due to their agreement with the Council of Reds, they had to save Earth-616 for last. After each of the attacks from the Multiversal Masters of Evil, Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos meet up with the [[Iron Inquisitor]] and Mephisto in the form of a dog as he nears the corpse of the [[Orb (comics)|Orb]]. Under Mephisto's orders, Doom Supreme unburns Uatu's eye fragment and puts it in his own eye. As Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos enter a portal to meet with their teammates and get back to work, Mephisto and the Iron Inquisitor talk about what to do with the Multiversal Masters of Evil as Mephisto's dog form eats at the fragments of Uatu's eye. Then he has the Orb's corpse dumped into the ocean.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #51-54. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Serpent Society]] later performed a ritual to summon the \"serpent\" that they worshiped by taking some lives of the people in Serpent Solutions' old headquarters. When the Avengers arrive and found that Nighthawk defeated them, the portal that formed during the ritual summons Mephisto's dog form, as it was mentioned by Nighthawk that the serpent was one of Mephisto's forms. Before assuming his true form and retreating, Mephisto makes the Council of Reds known to the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #55. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the distant past, Mephisto encounters [[Loki (Marvel Comics)#Avenger Prime|Avenger Prime]] who states that he came to watch Mephisto lose. They watch as the Avengers arrive and confront the Prehistoric Avengers. As both Avengers fight, Avenger Prime goes on the offensive against Mephisto as Mephisto summons the Council of Reds to help subdue him. The Council of Reds begin their attack on the Avengers Tower in the God Quarry as the Ghost Rider's Hell Charger drives into some of them.<ref>''Avengers Assemble Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Council of Reds have been decimated by the Multiversal Avengers with help from [[Wolverine (character)#Old Man Phoenix|Old Man Phoenix]] and the Granddaughters of [[King Thor]], Captain Marvel, Nighthawk, and [[Alternative versions of Thor (Marvel Comics)#Earth-56377|Thor of Earth-56377]] find a smaller version of Mephisto who is the last of the Council of Reds. Just then, Mephisto appears and absorbs his variant as he appears in giant size, claiming that the Council of Reds had served their purpose. He then quotes \"Welcome, Avengers, to the end of everything\".<ref>''Avengers: Forever'' (vol. 2) #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Critical reception===
George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' stated, \"Mephisto may be one of Marvel's most iconic, enduring villains - and that's no surprise considering he's based on the archetype of the Christian devil, pretty much the most iconic 'villain' in religion, folklore, and in some cases, even as a metaphorical force in world history. Marvel's comic book take on the concept of an omnipotent, omniscient infernal manipulator who rules over his own realm of eternal punishment through treachery and torture has had a similar impact on the history of the Marvel Universe.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web |author1=George Marston |date=2021-11-09 |title=Fans are seeing Mephisto all over Spider-Man - No Way Home and comic books may prove them right |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/mephisto-marvel-mcu/ |access-date=2022-10-31 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref> Marc Buxton of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Mephisto one of the \"greatest monstrous creations that ever sprang from the nightmares of the House of Ideas,\" writing, \"You can\u2019t very well have a list of the most nefarious Marvel monsters without listing the devil, hisownself. Not really the Biblical devil, Mephisto is a netherworldly tempter, a soul broker, and a liar who pretty much serves the same exact purpose as the Devil but he won\u2019t get Marvel in trouble with Christian conservatives. Mephisto first battled the Silver Surfer in the Silver Age (HEY!) and has bedeviled (hiYO) just about every Marvel hero. He recently pissed off fandom by cutting a Faustian deal with Peter Parker and erasing Spidey\u2019s marriage. Mephisto was a key figure in The Infinity Gauntlet, constantly whispering Iago like in Thanos\u2019 ear and is the very symbol of corruption in the Marvel Universe.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |last=Buxton |first=Marc |date=2015-10-30 |title=Marvel's 31 Best Monsters |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/comics/marvels-31-best-monsters/ |access-date=2022-10-31 |website=Den of Geek |language=en-US}}</ref>
