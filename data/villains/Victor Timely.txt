'''[[Mayor]] Victor Timely''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a divergent version of the [[time travel]]ler [[Kang the Conqueror|Nathaniel Richards]], a descendant of the [[Nathaniel Richards (Marvel Comics)|scientist of the same name]], whose alternate selves include [[Pharaoh Rama-Tut]], [[Scarlet Centurion]], [[Kang the Conqueror]], and [[Iron Lad|Iron Lad / Kid Immortus]]. Establishing a small, quiet town called Timely, [[Wisconsin]] in 1901 to serve as a 20th-century base for his future self, becoming an industrial opponent of [[Henry Ford]] and [[Thomas Edison]], Timely fakes his death and poses as his own son '''Victor Timely Jr.''' (and later his grandson '''Victor Timely III'''), educating [[Phineas Horton]] to eventually create the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], eventually becoming the new '''Kang Prime''' by the time of ''[[Kang Dynasty]]''.

The character made his feature film debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]'' (2023), portrayed by [[Jonathan Majors]], and will return in the 2023 [[Loki (TV series)|second season]] of the MCU television series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
At some point in his personal timeline, a humiliated divergent version of [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] decides to abandon the 21st Century and set his sights on conquering the 20th, travelling back in time to January 1, 1901 and founding the town of Timely, [[Wisconsin]], growing a moustache and taking the new name of \"Victor Timely\", as the town's mayor. Building a corporate empire, Timely Industries, he builds a series of factories for common machinery ahead of [[Henry Ford]] and [[Thomas Edison]], while instilling in his company's workers unflinching loyalty and knowledge of robotics. Subsequently, Timely uses his town to establishing the time-crossroads of [[Chronopolis (Marvel Comics)|Chronopolis]] intended to serve as city-state headquarters for all future versions of himself. Originally confined to the town itself, the fortress gradually grows out of sync with time and space into the outskirts of [[Limbo]], becoming a crossroads between past, present, and future, where one can walk between all time periods without requiring the use of a time machine, accessible via a portal. When away in Chronopolis, Timely is replaced by [[robot]]ic [[stand-in]]s remotely run by [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] copies of himself, which would age and die over time, allowing him to fake his death and assume the mantle of his own \"son\", Victor Timely, Junior.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marston|first=George|date=February 17, 2023|title=Victor Timely \u2014 The Comic History of the Kang Variant|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/victor-timely-kang-marvel|access-date=February 17, 2023|website=[[GamesRadar]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1929, Timely employs [[Phineas Horton]] to develop the technology to allow him to eventually create the original [[Human Torch]] by 1939, allowing Timely a secret backdoor to take control of the android. By the 1980s (modern-day; [[floating timeline]]), now presenting as his own grandson Victor Timely III, Timely Industries' technology stretches out to include the security measures behind the [[Baxter Building]] and [[Avengers Tower]], and the robotic limbs of every [[cyborg]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], in particular [[Misty Knight]] and [[Deathlok]], allowing him to control their actions and eventually supplant Kang Prime with his former name, becoming the Anachronauts, his soldiers in Chronopolis, granting Timely (now Kang Prime) control over [[Sentinel (comics)|the Sentinels]] in ''[[Kang Dynasty]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marnell|first=Blair|date=July 23, 2021|title=The Many Faces of Kang|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/versions-of-kang-in-the-comics|access-date=July 23, 2021|website=[[Marvel.com]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Victor Timely has no superpowers, but he does possess a [[genius]]-level intellect and amassed an extensive knowledge of 20th Century history, allowing him to dominate the mechanical industry of the time, and build a series of robotic duplicates of himself to allow him to publicly present as ageing, hiding his [[immortality]] from the public by posing as his own sons, and allow his future selves an advantage over their adversaries.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #7 (March 2009)</ref>
