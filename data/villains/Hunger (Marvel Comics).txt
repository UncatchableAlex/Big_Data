'''Hunger''' ('''Loxias Crown''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in the [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #76 (January 1997) and was created by [[Howard Mackie]]. He is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]], [[Blade (character)|Blade]], and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]].

[[Matt Smith]] portrayed a composite character partially inspired by Hunger named '''Milo''' whose real name is '''Lucien''' in the [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]] (SSU) film ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' (2022).

==Publication history==
Created by [[Howard Mackie]], the character first appeared in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #76 (January 1997).

==Fictional character biography==
Loxias Crown was an agent of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] equipped with armor that manipulates [[darkforce]]. After killing the armor's creator, William Fields, Crown takes [[Empire State University]]'s staff and students as hostages to locate Fields' notes on his armor's technology, but is defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and [[S.H.O.C.]]<ref>''Spider-Man'' #76 (January 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> Crown next abducted [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]] to perform experiments alongside Dr. Andrea Janson for [[Don Fortunato]]. Crown threatened Peter Parker until Todd Fields (now known as Neil Aiken) surrendered, teleporting the two youths to his secret base.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #79. Marvel Comics.</ref> But after [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] killed his love and captured his three hostages, Crown took Hydra's airship to get revenge. He fought both Spider-Man and S.H.O.C. and prepared to overload the latter's armor to kill everyone, but Morbius attacked and drained him dry while disappearing in the process.<ref name=\"Spider-Man Vol 1.80\">''Spider-Man'' #80. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Crown next lived in New York City's sewers as a \"Living Vampire\" known as Hunger, an enforcer of [[Senator Ward (comics)|Senator Stuart Ward]].<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #8 (August 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> He abducted innocent civilians and the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]' leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] to his lair beneath the streets. The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' went to investigate but Hunger knocked Parker out and took [[Betty Brant]] hostage. Spider-Man teamed up with [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] to free the prisoners, much to Hunger's annoyance. [[Flash Thompson]] distracted Hunger, resulting in his defeat by Spider-Man and Marrow but escapes in energy form.<ref name=\"Spider-Man Vol 2.4\">''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> Hunger later attacked a clandestine meeting between the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], and turned a number of gangsters into his own small army of living vampires. [[Blade (character)|Blade]] and Spider-Man tracked Hunger down to an abandoned [[Roxxon]] plant, fighting the two superheroes until he fled after his horde's deaths.<ref name=\"Spider-Man Vol 2.7\">''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #7 (July 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Loxias Crown wore an armor similar to S.H.O.C. which gave him the ability to channel negative energy and fire energy blasts. 

As a \"Living Vampire\", Hunger does not possess all the powers of a supernatural vampire, nor is he subject to all the traditional limitations and weaknesses thereof. He possesses a variety of superhuman powers, some of which are similar to supernatural vampires within the Marvel Universe, such as superhuman strength, speed and durability, as well as heightened senses including [[night vision]] and [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].<ref name=\"Spider-Man Vol 2.7\" /> Due to his vampire-like condition, Hunger is forced to ingest fresh blood on a regular basis to sustain his life and vitality.<ref name=\"Spider-Man Vol 2.4\" /> He does not possess any of the mystical vulnerabilities that supernatural vampires are subject to, such as [[garlic]], [[holy water]], [[crucifix]]es, or [[silver]]. He has a strong aversion to sunlight, thanks to his photo-sensitive skin which allows some protection from major sunburn, in contrast to \"true\" vampires that are incinerated by it, with the result that he can move in daylight, but his powers are diminished and he will stick to the shade if circumstances demand him to be active during the day.<ref name=\"Spider-Man Vol 2.4\" />

==Reception==
* In 2022, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Hunger 9th in their \"10 Most Important Marvel Vampires\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Saffle |first=Ben |date=2022-02-10 |title=The 10 Most Important Marvel Vampires, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/most-important-marvel-vampires/ |access-date=2022-11-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

Milo's family wealth is key to Morbius's research for a cure, but causes \"pseudo-vampirism\", with Morbius seeking to resist the resulting bloodlust while Milo embraces it. After Milo kills Nicholas and fatally injures Dr. [[Martine Bancroft]], Morbius restrains Milo with an army of vampire bats and kills him with a vampire-antibody.
