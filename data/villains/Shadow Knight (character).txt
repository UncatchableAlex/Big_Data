'''Shadow Knight''' ('''Randall Spector''') is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly as an adversary of his brother, the [[superhero]] [[Moon Knight]].

A young Randall makes his [[live-action]] debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television [[miniseries]] ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'', played by Claudio Fabian Contreras.

== Publication history ==
{{unsourced section|date=September 2022}}
Randall Spector was introduced in the \"backup feature\" of ''Hulk! Magazine'' #17 in October 1979 as a mysterious [[serial killer]] known as the Hatchet-Man who murders nurses around [[New York City]]. [[Moon Knight]] attempts to stop the murders and eventually deduces that the killer is his estranged brother Randall. In #18, Moon Knight confronts his brother in [[Central Park]] and a fight ensues in which Randall is killed. This was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by writer [[Howard Mackie]] to be an impostor, and in ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #33 and #35\u201338, Randall returns. During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' crossover, writer [[Gregg Hurwitz]] and artist [[Ron Garney]] wrote a three issue limited series where Moon Knight deals with his brother in a final confrontation. This is also the first time Randall is referred to as Marc's younger brother; in all previous appearances, it has been clearly stated that Randall is the older sibling.

== Fictional character biography ==
Randall Spector was born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], and is the son of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: E#Elias Spector|Elias Spector]], a [[rabbi]] who survived [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] persecution. Randall and Marc are brothers, and at times both have been cast as the avatars of the Egyptian moon god [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]]. Randall Spector grew up with his brother Marc, playing army games with him. He followed his brother into the Marine Corps, and eventually they both became mercenaries in northern [[Italy]]. It was later discovered that Randall killed Marc's then-nurse girlfriend. Marc chased his brother until there was a confrontation. Marc threw a grenade at Randall's sniper position, thinking he killed him, but then Randall returns to New York on a murder spree focused on killing nurses with a [[hatchet]]. Moon Knight uses his girlfriend Marlene as bait, but he can't stop  being stabbed. He swears revenge but cannot kill his brother. Randall then jumps at Marc, but he dodges; however, Randall impales himself in a tree branch.<ref>''Hulk Magazine'' #17-18</ref>

It is later revealed that the person killed was not Randall but an impostor with implanted memories. Randall is actually a member of the Cult of Khonshu, having been mystically enhanced with impenetrable skin and superhuman strength by Princess [[Nephthys]].<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' # 37</ref>

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Randall mysteriously re-emerged as the Shadow Knight, convinced by [[Profile (Marvel Comics)|The Profile]] that he is the next Khonshu [[avatar]] on Earth.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #13</ref> Sharing essentially all of the Moon Knight's powers, except that he can emit a radioactive blast from his eyes, the two are almost evenly matched. Randall attacks Moon Knight's pregnant girlfriend, Marlene.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #2</ref> The two eventually meet up in [[New Orleans]] following the mysterious Sapphire Crescent. Randall ends up using a hostage as a shield with a bomb, and Moon Knight is out of throwing crescents; however, Moon Knight launches the Sapphire Crescent and kills his brother.
<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #3</ref>

The Shadow Knight made his return in Strange #4 as a revenant, under the direction of the Blasphemy Cartel, enemies of Clea Strange. His body was taken over by rebellious dead souls that reanimated it and fought Clea Strange and her mother, the warlord Umar.

== Powers and abilities ==
Nepthys' \"lunar treatments\" granted him superhuman strength and external durability, although his internal organs were like those of a normal human's. Randall Spector possessed extensive training in espionage and military combat tactics. However, he was barely able to access these skills after becoming insane.

=== Equipment ===
As the Hatchet-Man, he used an off-the-shelf Halloween mask to hide his face.

As Shadow Knight, he wore Kevlar body armor for further protection.

=== Weapons ===
Wooden-handled hatchet.

== In other media ==
A young Randall Spector appears in flashbacks in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] / [[Disney+]] miniseries ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'' episode \"[[Asylum (Moon Knight)|Asylum]]\", portrayed by Claudio Fabian Contreras.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hood |first=Cooper |date=April 27, 2022 |title=Moon Knight Cast Guide: Every Marvel Character & Who Plays Them |url=https://screenrant.com/moon-knight-cast-guide-marvel-characters/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220506055829/https://screenrant.com/moon-knight-cast-guide-marvel-characters/ |archive-date=May 6, 2022 |access-date=May 6, 2022 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref> This version died in a flooded cave that he and his older brother [[Marc Spector (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Marc]] found.
