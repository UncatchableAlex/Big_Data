==Fictional character biography==
=== Early life ===
Nothing is known about Anton Mogart's past before he started stealing great works of art, jewels and such from locations all around the world, the thefts taking place promptly at midnight, which earned him the name Midnight Man. He lived in an opulent [[New Jersey]] mansion and stole these things simply to own them, not for the money.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Moon Knight ===
On the 22ed day of a theft spree in New York City, Mogart stole a rare Monet oil painting from the Ramadan Art Gallery. He was later stopped by [[Moon Knight]] and fell into the river and was presumed drowned. In actuality he was carried by the current to New York and the mouth of a drainage viaduct. There the wastes in the sewer melted his face leaving him deformed. Hiding in the sewers for three days he returned to his home to find the police had taken all his stolen goods. Blaming Moon Knight for this and his deformity, he vowed vengeance. Driven insane he lived in the sewers and started collecting trash instead of treasure. He worked with [[Raoul Bushman]] who lured Moon Knight into a flooding sewage chamber with Midnight Man in it. Moon Knight was able to chisel an escape route in the brick and Midnight Man was once again washed down a river.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Moon Knight'' #10.
