=== Modern Age ===
The leader of the Neyaphem, Azazel, is the only one who is able to breach the dimensional void and return to Earth for brief periods of time due to his teleportation powers.

=== Brimstone Dimension Opening ===
Azazel's other children are all mysteriously called to gather and sacrifice themselves on the island known as the Isla Des Demonas to open a portal and bring his army to Earth, with the goal of destroying both the Cheyarafim and what Azazel calls \"normal mutants\", mutants whose bodies do not show signs of their mutation, and who are not seen as monsters and demons. In addition to Nightcrawler, another son of Azazel's is the Genoshan called Abyss. The children of Azazel all join each other in a zombie-like state and open a portal to his dimension. A group of X-Men had followed Kurt to see where he was going, and jump into the portal once it opens. Once inside, Azazel takes great pleasure in toying with the team, having them believe that he is actually Satan. In the end, the X-Men defeat Azazel and his army and banish him to an unknown oblivion. The X-Men, including Nightcrawler, are able to escape, along with two other children of Azazel: Abyss and Kiwi Black.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #429-434.</ref>

=== Return ===
Azazel's whereabouts are unknown for several years, but he resurfaces in this dimension, accompanied by a few Azazel-like Bamfs, revealing himself to be the master of Calcabrina, former ally of Frankenstein's Monster, and banned from all realms of Hell.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (Vol. 2) #1-5.</ref>

=== Weapon X-Force ===
Confronted by a shape-shifted Mystique, a disguise he easily sees through, Azazel is asked to join Mystique to the realm of Hell to fight the newly resurrected William Stryker, who has become demonic. Weapon X-Force is close in perimeter, and Sabertooth grows agitated with the lack of progression towards the mission's goal, eventually having the team reveal themselves to attack Azazel, with the plan to force teleport them to the realm of Hell Stryker resides in. Azazel quickly overpowers the team and obliges the request because of the ties Mystique has with Sabertooth. In order to send them to Hell, the Weapon X-Force are killed by Azazel, as they are sinners designated for eternal damnation prior. Due to Weapon X-Force's regenerative healing, Azazel keeps the team in suspended animation with the use of his teleportation abilities. Frozen in time, the team's souls are able to be transported to Hell to complete the mission and Azazel is to unfreeze them to return them to their individual bodies once they are revived with their healing factors.<ref name=\"Weapon X Vol 3 #25\">''Weapon X'' Vol 3 #25</ref><ref name=\"Weapon X Vol 3 #26\"/>

=== House of X ===
Azazel is eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of Krakoa, created by Xavier, Magneto, and Moira X. He enters through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who are invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.<ref>''House of X'' #5</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Here Are All the X-Men Villains That Showed up in Marvel's House of X #5 |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-house-x-5-x-men-villains-cameos-list/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Adams |first=Tim |date=2019-09-18 |title=House of X Opens Krakoa's Doors to the X-Men's Greatest Villains |url=https://www.cbr.com/house-of-x-krakoa-x-men-villains/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>
