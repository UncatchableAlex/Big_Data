==Fictional character biography==
Dragon Man is an android built by '''Professor Gregson Gilbert''' of Empire State University as an experiment. Gregson hoped to find a way to bring it to life. He could not find a way to do this until the alchemist [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]] arrived and brought it to life under his partial control using his supernatural powers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Morales |first=Carlos |date=2022-07-24 |title=Fantastic Four: 5 Villains Who Could Appear (Who Aren\u2019t Doctor Doom) {{!}} Comic-Con 2022 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-5-villains-who-could-appear-who-arent-doctor-doom-comic-con-2022 |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> However, Dragon Man broke his control and attempted to kill Diablo.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby]] | Inker = [[Chic Stone]] | Story = Calamity On The Campus! | Title = Fantastic Four | Volume = 1 | Issue = #35 | Date = February 1965 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=107}}</ref>

Although Dragon Man is slow-minded to the point that he is incapable of speech, he understands orders given by Diablo and is a determined foe of the [[Fantastic Four]] (although the creature has always displayed a [[King Kong]]-like affection towards [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]]). Dragon Man is not especially malicious, although he is easily manipulated and provoked to violence.

After his first activation, Dragon Man was later revived. He encountered [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], and fought the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44-47</ref>

Dragon Man was later studied by [[Hank Pym]] at his laboratory. He was restored to life again by Diablo and was defeated by Pym as Goliath and escaped.<ref>''The Avengers'' #41</ref> Dragon Man battled [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] destroyed Diablo's army of Dragon Men.<ref>''The Avengers'' #42</ref>

Dragon Man was once found by the original [[X-Men]] and was considered an unofficial mascot of sorts. After a period of time on the team where he developed a deep affection for [[Jean Grey]], Dragon Man had to be released to the creature-filled island known in the Marvel Universe as Monster Island.

Dragon Man was reclaimed by Professor Gregson Gilbert and sent by [[Lemuel Dorcas]] to attack [[Namor]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #15</ref> It was next used by Gregory Gideon to attack the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #134-135</ref> Dragon Man was then sent by [[Machinesmith]] to attack [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #248-249</ref> He became the mount for the extra-dimensional dragon rider [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Ral Dorn|Ral Dorn]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #16</ref> Dragon Man then fought [[Hulk]] and [[Kate Waynesboro]] when it was under the control of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] and the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #292</ref>

Dragon Man encountered the child superheroes called [[Power Pack]]. Gregson Gilbert later attempted to replicate the creation of the Dragon Man without the addition of alchemical interruptions, and this time succeeded. He created a number of androids based on other [[legendary creature]]s. These androids were defeated by Power Pack, and Gilbert and Dragon Man go to work at Disneyland.<ref>''Power Pack'' #7</ref>

Dragon Man was used as a servant of [[Aron (comics)|Aron]] the Rogue [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #321-323, 327-330, 332-333</ref>

He faced [[Spider-Man]] during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', when he was unleashed on him by [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #61</ref>

In addition to his servitude to Diablo, Dragon Man has served [[Super-Adaptoid]] and was also a member of the [[New Enforcers]]. In ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #235-6, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] sprung him from a government containment facility to capture and dissect him to create robotic super-soldiers based on Dragon Man's powers. He was freed by [[Ben Reilly]].

Dragon Man showed up in Africa under the influence of mad scientist '''Eric Pain'''.<ref>''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 4 #8-9 and ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #175-176</ref> Though the creature was under a full rage, he ended up defeated once more by both superheroes. Afterwards, he resurfaced in [[Beyond!]], destroying an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] the group was using to escape.

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline,<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #4</ref> he was spotted at the funeral of [[Stilt-Man]]. After poisoning the guests, the [[Punisher]] blew up the bar in which the wake had been held. He was later seen being arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #9</ref>

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #13</ref> including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Quincy McIver|Bushmaster]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, the Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].

In ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #8, Dragon Man had been captured by the trainee heroes, having been attracted to [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]].

In ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'', Dragon Man was seen battling the newly revived ''Nova Corps'' consisting of Qubit, Fraktur, Tracel, Morrow, Irani, and Robbie Rider. He was subdued by the Corps using a gravimetric net.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #20</ref>

At one point, Dragon Man had been placed in the [[Negative Zone]], and like most of the other prisoners, was conscripted into service when [[Blastaar]] attacked the prison. When the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Shadow Initiative]] was sent in to liberate the prison, Blastaar sent Dragon Man against them. However, Komodo was able to use Dragon Man's attraction to her to convince him to switch sides.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27</ref>

Following this, he seemingly reforms, as he, [[Artie Maddicks|Artie]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] were seen at [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' birthday party.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #574</ref>

He has since been upgraded by [[Valeria Richards]] and joined Reed Richards' [[Future Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kahn |first=Juliet |date=2020-04-28 |title=Marvel Teams We Want To See In The MCU |url=https://www.looper.com/205301/marvel-teams-we-want-to-see-in-the-mcu/ |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=Looper |language=en-US}}</ref> Valeria used her talents to upgrade Dragon Man to have super-intellect and have the power of human speech. Dragon Man would become an adopted member of the Future Foundation and guardian of the gifted children in that program.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four579\">''Fantastic Four'' #579</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Dragon Man created the Thing Rings for Darla Deering to wear which enables her to become Miss Thing upon some particles enabling her to transform into her Thing Exoskeleton (which was also modified by Dragon Man).<ref>''Marvel NOW! Point One'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dragon Man gains its powers from its robotic materials, design, and construction, as well as unknown alchemical potions used by [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. He is superhumanly strong and durable, being able to stand toe to toe with the likes of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the [[Hulk]] in combat situations. He can use the wings on his back to fly.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harth |first=David |date=2020-05-07 |title=DC: 5 Marvel Villains Donna Troy Would Defeat (& 5 She'd Lose To) |url=https://www.cbr.com/dc-marvel-villains-donna-troy-would-defeat-wonder-woman/ |access-date=2023-03-03 |website=CBR |language=en}}</ref> Dragon Man can also exhale methane gas (produced by his digestive system) which can be ignited by striking together his specialized teeth, producing flame hot enough to melt [[iron]].

Dragon Man originally could military press sixty tons. Since it was a machine imbued with magic the artificial creature never grows tired. It can recharge itself by eating organic materials, and its wings did not allow it to fly. It uses two anti gravity generators located in its body to propel itself. Its large wings give it great mobility in the air. He was initially non-sentient, but had the capacity for limited self-motivated activity. He has been reprogrammed by Valeria Richards and now has super-intellect and the capability of human speech.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four579\" />
