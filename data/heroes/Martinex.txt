==Fictional character biography==
In their future, [[Earth]] had colonized several planets in its [[Solar System]], including [[Pluto]]. Martinex was born on Cerberus Center, Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of Africa on Earth.

He grew up to become a [[scientist]] and technician. Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystalline in appearance. This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world. Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands. Martinex became the last surviving Plutonian after the [[Badoon]] exterminated all the other Plutonians, as he was working on Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. The Pluvians had been forewarned of the attack, but the ship they were escaping on was destroyed by the Badoon. Martinex escaped the Badoon using a telepod and teamed with [[Vance Astro]], a [[human]] [[astronaut]] from the 20th century with psychic powers, [[Charlie-27]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] who was the last of his race as well, and [[Yondu]], from [[Alpha Centauri]], to fight the Badoon as the freedom fighters, the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Arnold Drake|Drake, Arnold]]|penciller= [[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]]|inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]]|story= Guardians of the Galaxy!|title= [[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]|issue= #18|date= Jan. 1969}}</ref> It was later revealed [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] had manipulated events to bring them together.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}
