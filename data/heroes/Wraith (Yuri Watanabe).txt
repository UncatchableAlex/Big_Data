'''Wraith''' ('''Yuriko''' \"'''Yuri'''\" '''Watanabe''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

== Publication history ==
Yuri Watanabe first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #600, and was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[John Romita Jr.]] She first appeared as Wrath in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663.

== Fictional character biography ==
Yuri Watanabe was a captain in the New York Police Department (NYPD) and an ally of Spider-Man's like her friend and mentor [[Jean DeWolff]]. However, she was shown to be frustrated with how the justice system and the police were unable to deal with powerful and wealthy criminals who could always find a way to escape justice for their crimes.

Shortly thereafter, a new vigilante, the Wraith, starts targeting [[Mister Negative]]'s criminal syndicate. During one such attack, the Wraith unmasks to reveal DeWolff's face, although this is later revealed to be one of the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]]'s masks stolen from police evidence.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663</ref> It is later revealed that the Wraith is really Yuri pretending to be DeWolff's ghost to scare the criminals of New York, using a costume in imitation of Spider-Man to achieve the results she sought.<ref name=\"auto1\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #664</ref>

Wraith accompanies forensic expert [[Carlie Cooper]] on a visit to Grand Taur\u00f3, where they pursue underworld financier Antoine Morant, searching for information on the secret bank account of the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]]'s mind in Spider-Man's body). Carlie and the Wraith catch up with Morant shredding some documents out of fear. Carlie recovers one of the documents, discovering that all of the Superior Spider-Man's equipment and technology for the Arachnauts, as well as the order for Spiderlings, are being paid for using the secret account, putting Carlie one step closer to finding the evidence needed to prove the new Spider-Man's true identity.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19</ref>

After Carlie is kidnapped by the original Goblin King, Yuri investigates Otto hoping to find Carlie's whereabouts. She confronts Otto during the Goblin Nation's attack for info on Carlie but is knocked out by the transformed Carlie. She then aids the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and their ally Cardiac against the Goblin Knight with assistance from Peter Parker who eventually regains his place as Spider-Man from Otto.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31</ref>

In the \"Spiral\" storyline, Yuri's faith in the justice system is permanently shattered when crime boss [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] is released from prison after gunning down one of her friends during a shootout with the police. She receives photographic evidence from Mister Negative that Judge Howell, who signed off on Tombstone's release, received a favor in return and arrests the judge without contacting the NYPD after obtaining more evidence as the Wraith with Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #16.1</ref> She continues to receive tips from Mister Negative on where big crime lords such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and the second Goblin King are meeting so she and Spider-Man can take them down.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #17.1</ref>

Spider-Man notices she is being more brutal in her approach and believes Mister Negative is using her. This is later proven right when Mister Negative begins to take over the territories of his incarcerated rivals and tries to frame the Wraith as a murderer. When Howell dies in prison from a stab wound, Yuri's superior confiscates her badge and she is dismissed from the force. After a fight with the [[Circus of Crime]], she realizes she has been playing into Mister Negative's hands and kills one of his men, declaring that \"Watanabe the cop\" no longer exists and that only the Wraith is left.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #19.1</ref> When she attempts to kill Mister Negative, Spider-Man tries to convince her to change her ways. She decides that killing criminals rather than arresting them is more fulfilling and attacks her former ally, but Spider-Man knocks her out and goes on to defeat Mister Negative himself. Spider-Man later finds Yuri has abandoned her costume, but kept her Wraith mask.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #20.1</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
The Wraith primarily used technology obtained by the police from various Spider-Man villains, including a mask of Jean DeWolff's face from Chameleon to hide her true identity, equipment designed by Mysterio, and Mister Fear's Fear Gas. Her primary weapons are yellow elastic straps attached to her costume that wrap up her enemies and allow her to swing around the city similar to Spider-Man.<ref name=\"auto1\" />

Similarly to her comics counterpart, this version is an NYPD captain and long-time ally of [[Peter Parker (Insomniac Games character)|Spider-Man]]'s who aids him in foiling various crimes in New York, such as capturing [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] at the beginning of the game. In ''[[Spider-Man: The City That Never Sleeps|The City That Never Sleeps]]'' DLC, she is emotionally compromised after her department and Spider-Man's attempt to capture [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] results in the deaths of many of her officers. Taking matters into her own hands after becoming frustrated with Spider-Man's lack of progress, she goes on a violent quest for revenge against the crime lord. While trying to stop her, Spider-Man, with [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s help, discovers Yuri is a third generation police officer whose father was arrested for taking bribes from Hammerhead and that Yuri has dedicated her entire career to bringing the crime boss down, going from precinct to precinct as her zealousness became too much. Once she catches up to Hammerhead, she nearly shoots and kills him before Spider-Man redirects her shot. Put on administrative leave for her actions, she refuses to give up her vendetta and goes into hiding. She later kills one of Hammerhead's top enforcers and uses crime scenes connected to him to lead Spider-Man to the enforcer's body, where she contacts her former ally to tell him she quit the force to become a vigilante, reasoning that the justice system does not work all the time.<ref>{{cite video game |title= Spider-Man (2018 video game)|developer= Insomniac Games|publisher= Sony Interactive Entertainment|date= September 7, 2018|platform= PlayStation 4}}</ref>
