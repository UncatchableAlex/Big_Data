'''Spider-Man Noir''' ('''Peter Parker''') is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Part of the [[Marvel Noir]] universe (Earth-90214), this [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate version]] of [[Spider-Man]] is a [[film noir|noir]]-themed take on the character and emerges in a version of New York during the [[Great Depression]]. While investigating a smuggling ring, Peter Parker is bitten by what seems to be a highly-venomous spider housed inside a spider-god idol. Falling unconscious, Parker has a vision of the spider-god promising him power. He then awakes inside a cocoon and emerges from it, now possessing super-human abilities similar to a spider. As the feared vigilante \"the Spider-Man,\" Parker wages a one-man war against the criminal underworld in New York City, partly to avenge the deaths of his uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and his mentor [[Ben Urich]] at the hands of the city's major crime lord, [[Norman Osborn]]. After Osborn's defeat, Spider-Man Noir continues his vigilante life for years and opposes the forces of [[Nazi Germany]] even before the United States enters [[World War II]]. In contrast to the Peter Parker of mainstream Marvel continuity, Spider-Man Noir initially uses brutal and lethal force against his enemies and later struggles with the moral implications of this.

Since his conception, the character has appeared in numerous media adaptations. His first appearance in other media was in the 2010 video game ''Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions'' where he was voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]]. In the cartoon series ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', he was voiced by actor [[Milo Ventimiglia]]. In the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]],'' he was voiced by actor [[Nicolas Cage]].

==Publication history==
In 2009, Marvel Comics created a line of [[Marvel Noir]] comics. Taking place in an alternate universe, these stories reinterpreted familiar Marvel Characters to better reflect a [[Hardboiled|hardboiled/crime noir]] atmosphere, with most of the adventures taking place in the United States during the [[Great Depression]] era. The Marvel Noir version of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], was created by writers [[David Hine]] and Fabrice Sapolsky, and artists [[Carmine Di Giandomenico]] (who drew his first stories) and [[Marko Djurdjevic]] (who designed his costume). Though he was not called \"Spider-Man Noir\" in the stories themselves, Marvel creators and comic fans use this nickname to distinguish him from the mainstream version of Spider-Man.

The Marvel Noir version of Peter Parker first appeared in the four-issue mini-series ''Spider-Man: Noir'' #1 in [[2009 in comics|2009]].<ref name=\"SMN#1\">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir| volume = | issue = 1| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref> The character became popular enough to quickly earn a sequel mini-series later that same year, entitled ''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' and produced by the same creative team. Spider-Man Noir appeared as a playable character in the 2010 video game ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]],'' a narrative where different Spider-Men across the multiverse joined forces against a common threat. The character was portrayed by actor [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]], who had voiced the character of Peter Parker in the 1994 animated ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series. This video game marked the first time Spider-Man Noir was depicted as being able to swing travel on web-lines (up to that point in his stories, he only created webbing to ensnare enemies or their weapons).

The character went on to appear in the 2014 story event ''[[Spider-Verse]],'' the main series of which was written by [[Dan Slott]] who had also scripted ''Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions'' earlier. After this, the hero featured in several multiverse crossover comics such as ''Secret Wars'', the second ''Spider-Verse'' series, and ''Web Warriors''. A version of the character  appeared in season three of the animated series ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' in 2015, voiced by [[Milo Ventimiglia]]. This animated version of Spider-Man Noir was the first to add a fedora hat to his costume.

In 2018, Spider-Man Noir was seemingly killed in the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' storyline, then appeared in December of that year in the theatrical movie ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]].'' Voiced by Nicolas Cage, the film version uses stereotypical 1930s dialogue and wears a slightly altered costume. Following the movie, Spider-Man Noir was resurrected in ''Spider-Verse'' vol. 3 #5 in 2020, his appearance, personality, and dialogue now similar to his movie counterpart. An ongoing ''Spider-Man Noir'' monthly comic book series began months later the same year, written by [[Margaret Stohl]] and with interior art by [[Juan Ferreyra]].

==Fictional character biography==
===''Spider-Man Noir'' Volume 1===
On Earth-90214 in the winter of 1932, during the [[Great Depression]], New York City is plagued by many criminal gangs. ''Daily Bugle'' photojournalist [[Ben Urich]], known to some criminals as \"the Spider,\" attends a public oration on the struggle of the common citizen by [[Aunt May|May Parker]] in [[Central Park]] and befriends her nephew Peter Parker. Unable to attend university due to lack of money, Peter shares that his Uncle Ben, who fought in [[World War I]] as a pilot, was recently murdered by criminals working for Norman Osborn, an industrialist believed to be the crime lord called [[Green Goblin|Goblin]].<ref name=\"SMN#1\"/> Peter recalls his Uncle Ben's words regarding the futility and unjust nature of World War I: \"If those in power can't be trusted, it's the responsibility of the people to remove them.\" Peter works for Urich and in December 1932, he ventures to a warehouse of stolen antiques. One artifact \u2014 a spider idol \u2014 breaks open and releases a horde of spiders. One bites Peter, causing him to pass out and dream of a spider-god who claims it will give Peter power. The young man awakes in a black web cocoon and frees himself, discovering he now has spider-like powers.<ref name=\"SMN#2\">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir| volume = | issue = 2| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

Donning a mask, Peter confronts Norman Osborn and is shocked to discover Urich present. The photojournalist has been blackmailing Osborn with his information on the mob boss's activities in exchange for the Goblin fueling his drug habit. Inspired by Peter's determination to fight the Goblin no matter what, Urich decides to expose Osborn's crimes but is murdered. He was color-blinded by an accident with oscorp. Meanwhile, Peter creates a costume using elements of his uncle's [[World War I]]-era airman uniform, becoming \"the Spider-Man.\"<ref name=\"SMN#2\" /> Urich's former lover [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]], owner of the Black Cat club, aids Peter's war on Osborn's criminal syndicate.<ref name=\"SMN#3\">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir| volume = | issue = 3| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

In January of 1933, the Spider-Man kills [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] to save his Aunt May, but the woman declares him just as bad for shooting an unarmed man he could have overpowered and captured instead. After Osborn's gang is largely defeated, Spider-Man has the opportunity to kill the Goblin but decides true justice means the man must stand trial and the truth become public record. [[Kraven the Hunter]], one of Osborn's other cronies who is dying, then attacks the Goblin, killing him.<ref name=\"SMN#4\">''Spider-Man Noir'' #4</ref> As winter turns to spring, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] is now President, Hitler rises in power in Europe, May Parker continues being an activist for the common people, and Spider-Man Noir continues fighting crime and corruption.<ref name=\"SMN#4\" />

===''Eyes Without a Face''===
''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' takes place roughly eight months after ''Spider-Man Noir''. In September 1933, Peter Parker continues to operate as a photojournalist and helps at May Parker's soup kitchen along with his friend [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Meanwhile, the masked [[Crime Master]] rises as the city's new crime boss. Peter develops a relationship with Felicia Hardy, but she insists she is not his girlfriend. Peter and his friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson]], a struggling reporter, investigate the [[Ellis Island]] lab of [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] and his assistant [[Lizard (character)|Dr. Curt Connors]], who are conducting strange experiments in mind control for the US government. That night, several kidnapped black people brought by [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint \"Sandman\" Marko]] are delivered to Octavius's lab. Secretly working with The [[Friends of New Germany]] (TFONG), Octavius intends to prove that \"inferior\" people can be controlled with brain surgery.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #1-2 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man tracks the Crime Master and is almost beaten to death by Marko, who is shot dead by the Police while the Crime Master escapes. Discovering she is connected to Spider-Man, the Crime Master attacks and disfigures Felicia Hardy, nearly killing her. Learning that Crime Master is delivering people of color to Octavius, Spider-Man goes to the lab on Ellis Island and finds Robbie, only to find the man has already undergone surgery on the [[frontal lobe]], leaving him without memory or clear free will.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #3 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Octavius and Crime Master come to blows and the latter is killed. FBI agent Jean de Wolfe (a male version of [[Jean DeWolff]]) arrives and Octavius is arrested. Spider-Man is told Felicia, still recovering from serious injuries and her face now scarred, does not want to see him again. A month later, the government decides to deport Octavius rather than put him on trial publicly and risk he will reveal state secrets. The scientist arrives in Germany only to be humiliated when he realizes the [[Nazis]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]] believe his congenital disability makes him inferior and his work useless. As time passes, Felicia recovers from her injuries but now wears a mask to cover her scars.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #4 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Verse''===
The ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline featured Spider heroes from various alternate realities being hunted by the vampiric Inheritors. The comic tie-in ''Edge of Spider-Verse #1'' returns to Earth-90214 where it is now August, 1939. Peter has been operating as the Spider-Man for six years and finally attended university classes, while his girlfriend Mary Jane spent three years in Spain fighting with the [[Lincoln Battalion|Abraham Lincoln International Brigade]]. [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] is a rising power in crime and sends illusionist [[Mysterio]] to kill the Spider-Man. Peter is then recruited by [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] to join a group of Spiders fighting against the Inheritors.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse'' vol. 1 #1 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Following an adventure in the ''Secret Wars'' crossover, Spider-Man Noir joins a team of six Spiders called the ''Web Warriors'' that regularly meets to combats threats to other dimensions, particularly those that no longer have a Spider hero of their own.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spider-Gwen Stars In Web Warriors Launched By Mike Costa And David Baldeon #MarvelOctober (UPDATE)|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/|access-date=April 2, 2019|website=www.bleedingcool.com|date=June 29, 2015 }}</ref>

The inter-dimensional Web of Life and Destiny becomes unstable due to the technology the Web Warriors use to travel between worlds. This causes some realities to bleed into each other and Spider-Man Noir's world to suffer time anomalies. Eventually, the team rights it and new teammate Octavia Otto helps create a better method of traveling between worlds that will not destabilize the Web.<ref>''Web Warriors'' #1-11 (2016). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Geddon'' and Death===
One night in 1940, Spider-Man Noir investigates a weapons sale between [[Shocker (character)|Herman Schultz]] and the Nazis. He fights alongside Felicia Hardy, now on speaking terms with him and operating as the masked vigilante White Widow. Spider-UK arrives and requests Spider-Man Noir on an important mission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spider-Geddon: Spider-Man Noir #1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsMAcYRiAts&t  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/dsMAcYRiAts |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|website=YouTube |access-date=October 10, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The Web Warriors try to stop the Inheritors from using cloning technology to resurrect, but are too late. Spider-Man Noir attempts to kill the Inheritor called [[Morlun]] with a grenade, sacrificing himself in the process. The Inheritor survives and drains Spider-Man Noir's remaining life-force, killing him.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #1 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Spider-Gwen travels to the Marvel Noir Earth to inform May Parker, Mary Jane, and Felicia Hardy how their version of Peter heroically died. May is furious to find out her nephew was a vigilante, \"a broken man,\" but Mary Jane and Felicia thank Gwen for giving them closure.<ref>''Spider-Gwen: Ghost-Spider'' #4 (2019)</ref>

===Resurrection===
In ''Spider-Verse'' volume 3 #5 (2020), it is revealed that following his death in ''Spider-Geddon,'' Spider-Man Noir woke up alive and well in a web-cocoon on his native Earth-90214, having had a vision of the spider-god telling him his \"service\" was not finished. Now slightly more introspective and glib, this Peter Parker officially starts working as a private investigator, adopting a slightly new look and a more stereotypical 1930s dialect (similar to his film incarnation from ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''). [[Miles Morales]] appears and teams-up with Spider-Man Noir to retrieve the spider-god's idol from the Nazis so it can be used to repair the trans-dimensional Web of Life and Destiny. The two succeed in getting the idol back, but Miles warns that taking it away from the Marvel Noir Earth may also remove the spider-god's protection, meaning Parker's next death will be permanent. Spider-Man Noir says he is fine with this as death is supposed to be permanent for everyone and he neither wants nor deserves special treatment.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 3 #5 (2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Man Noir'' Volume 2===
In 1939, a month after his team-up with Miles Morales, people are starting to realize the Spider-Man is alive and back in action. Peter has re-established ties with Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson, who are both grateful that \"a miracle\" brought him back from death. Both support his life as a vigilante, but May advises he act more honorably than his instincts sometimes tell him to. As the new series opens, J. Jonah Jameson helps Peter gain access to police crime scenes so the young private eye can investigate a murder and in exchange provide the ''Daily Bugle'' with the exclusive story. Peter's investigation into the death of Holly Babson, a waitress at the Black Cat club, leads him to fly to Europe alongside Holly's sister and museum curator, Huma Bergmann, to look more into a cicada gemstone that Holly was holding on to when she died. The two are eventually accompanied by Harry Charles, a pilot who is secretly part of the [[Dora Milaje]] named [[Shuri (character)|Hu-Ri]], and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Checkpoint Red]], a guide in Instanbul to help them on their journey to Babylon sent by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Throughout their travels, they are pursued by the Nazis and their powerful new weapon [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. As they approach the temple where the cicada gemstone originated, Huma double-crosses them and reveals that she is the goddess [[Inanna]], who lured them into Babylon and allied with the Nazis. She combines the cicada stone with the M'Kraan crystal to open a portal to the Underworld, which brings back some of Spider-Man's deceased enemies in the process. During the fight, Peter receives a vision from the spider-god [[Ereshkigal (Marvel Comics)|Ereshkigal]], who turns out to be Inanna's sister and took on the form of Holly Babson. With her help, Spider-Man destroys the cicada stone and the M'Kraan crystal, defeating Inanna and his undead foes in the process. He later returns to New York where Jameson credits Huma for stopping the Nazis in Babylon.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir'' Vol. 2 (2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
This incarnation of [[Spider-Man]] from Earth-90214 has the same basic powers as his classic counterpart: enhanced strength, speed, reflexes, resiliency, and agility proportionate to that of a spider; the ability to have his body cling to sheer walls or other solid surfaces; and a sixth sense which warns him of incoming danger, also known as \"spider-sense.\" While the mainstream Spider-Man uses mechanical web-shooters, Spider-Man Noir has the power to shoot organic webbing from his wrists. In his original two mini-series, Spider-Man Noir does not create web-lines, his dark webbing always manifesting as a spray or net.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir'' vol. 1 (2009)</ref> After his resurrection, his web control is fine enough that he regularly creates web-lines to swing on and web-based projectiles to stun opponents.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 3 #5, 2020. ''Spider-Man Noir'' vol. 2 (2020).</ref> Through his association with club owner Felicia Hardy, his vigilante activities, his associates at the ''Daily Bugle,'' and his occupation as a private investigator, he has a network of contacts throughout the city and several informants in the gangs.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' (2009-2010)</ref>

===Equipment===
In contrast to the mainstream Peter Parker, this Spider-Man's costume is mainly normal clothing of the era matched with a mask. The outfit includes [[kevlar]] armor, making it resistant to bullets and explosions. The \"costume\" part of his outfit includes a mask made with the headgear and the aviator glasses used by his uncle during the [[Great War]].<ref name=\"SMN#2\"/> After ''Spider-Geddon'', Spider-Man Noir adopts a more traditional version of the Spider-Man mask colored black and white, though he keeps the goggles rather than relying on built-in lenses. He also begins wearing a fedora with his mask and a new gun belt decorated by a spider-symbol.

Spider-Man Noir regularly uses .45 caliber pistols. He is a skilled marksman, adept in the use of various firearms such as revolvers and the [[tommy gun]]. He is willing to kill enemies in certain cases, but largely prefers to only injure criminals. Despite his superhuman abilities, Spider-Man Noir still relies on wearing glasses as Peter Parker, indicating his goggles may also involve prescription lenses.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir'' vol. 2 #1 (2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>
