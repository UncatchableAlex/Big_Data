[[Anya Taylor-Joy]] portrayed Illyana Rasputin in the 2020 film ''[[The New Mutants (film)|The New Mutants]]''.

==Publication history==
Illyana first appeared in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975), though her first name was not given until ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #145 (May 1981). For the first eight years of the character's existence, she was an infrequently appearing background character known as Colossus' little sister. The means of changing this was set in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160 (August 1982), in which she ages seven years while in a paranormal dimension called [[Otherplace|Limbo]], becomes a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]], and develops the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to create \"[[teleportation]] discs.\" These changes were not immediately explored or explained, and for the next year she remained essentially a background character.<ref name=\"Magikvariety\" />

In December 1983, the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Magik (Illyana and Storm)]]'' was launched, chronicling Illyana's years in Limbo, which is also her origin story. ''Magik'' #1 (Dec. 1983) is her first cover appearance as young Illyana, her second full appearance and the first time she get the name Magik. ''Magik'' #2 (Jan. 1984) is her first cover appearance as adult Magik. Immediately following the end of the series, she was added to the cast of the [[New Mutants]],<ref name=\"New Mutants #14\">''The New Mutants'' #14 (April 1984)</ref> appearing regularly in that comic from ''The New Mutants'' #14 (April 1984), the first cover appearance of adult Magik in costume, to ''The New Mutants'' #77 (July 1989), in which she returns to her family in Russia after having reverted to childhood. As the younger sister of Colossus and a member of the New Mutants, she also sporadically appeared as a guest star in ''Uncanny X-Men''.<ref name=\"Magikvariety\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/new-mutants-who-is-magik-history-anya-taylor-joys-x-men-character-1002851 |title=The 'New Mutants' Backstory That's Crazy, Even by Comic Book Standards |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 11, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110032224/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/new-mutants-who-is-magik-history-anya-taylor-joys-x-men-character-1002851 |archive-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Illyana Rasputin (born Illyana Nikolaievna Rasputina) was born in the Ust-Ordynski [[Collective farm]], near [[Lake Baikal]], [[Siberia]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]] to Nikolai Rasputin and his wife Alexandra Natalya Rasputina. Illyana's two older brothers, [[Mikhail Nikolaievitch Rasputin]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (Piotr \"Peter\" Nikolaievitch Rasputin) are also [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Colossus' superhuman powers manifest while saving Illyana from a runaway tractor.<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Image:Magik4.jpg|thumb|left|A transformed Illyana becomes a powerful sorceress and ruler of Limbo in ''[[Magik (comics)|Magik]]''.]]
At six years old, Illyana is abducted and brought to the United States by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], who uses her and several other hostages to coerce the X-Men into opposing [[Doctor Doom]]. She is rescued and brought back to the X-Mansion.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w). ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #145-147. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Illyana is called to the [[Otherplace|Limbo]] dimension by [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], who seeks to bring forth the Elder Gods to rule Earth.<ref name=\"UX160\">Claremont, Chris (w). ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is raised there, frequently bullied and tormented by Belasco's underling [[S'ym]].<ref>[[Simonson, Louise]] (w). ''The New Mutants'' #71. Marvel Comics.</ref> To free himself, Belasco needs to fill the Beatrix Medallion with five bloodstones. The bloodstones are created by corrupting Illyana's soul, with a new stone appearing as her corruption deepens. She is rescued and tutored in the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|white magic]] by that dimension's version of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] (who turned to magic when her mutant powers waned).<ref>''Magik'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Finding the use of magic abhorrent, Limbo's version of [[Shadowcat]], known as Cat, kidnaps and trains Illyana in hand to hand and sword combat. Cat, along with Illyana, storms Belasco's citadel. They are overwhelmed by Belasco who further transforms Cat into a feline demonic creature.<ref>''Magik'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Illyana back under his control, Belasco instructs her in the art of black magic in the hopes that it will further corrupt her soul. However, Illyana plots Belasco's defeat and continues to resist the dark influence on her soul.<ref>''Magik'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Illyana forms a mystical bond between both Storm and Cat, who were also tutored by Belasco.<ref>''Magik'' limited series, and ''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #9 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Belasco succeeds in creating three parts of Illyana's bloodstone pendant. Illyana creates the Soulsword and takes over Limbo as its new ruler. While wielding the Soulsword she manifests horns, a tail and fangs. She banishes Belasco from Limbo<ref name=\"MIS4\">''Magik'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> and claims S'ym as her servant. She then returns to Earth a decade older, although no time has passed on Earth since her kidnapping.<ref name=\"UX160\"/> She subsequently joins the [[New Mutants]].<ref name=\"New Mutants #14\"/>

Magik misguides one of her teleportation discs through the space-time continuum and strands herself and [[Dani Moonstar|Mirage]] in ancient Egypt.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> There, Illyana meets Storm's ancestor Ashake, an Egyptian priestess. Together, they defeat an evil sorcerer, Heka-Nut, who sought an ancient mystical sword called the Sword of Bone using Magik's Soulsword. Ashake helps Illyana and Mirage return to the present, with Mirage's memory of the incident erased in the process.<ref name=\"Arcanna\">''Mystic Arcanna'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A strange armor begins to appear on her body each time she wields the Soulsword. The armor appears only on one of her shoulders and arms at first,<ref>''The New Mutants'' #18-20. Marvel Comics.</ref> but appears on more of her body each time that she wields the sword.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #50, 66, 72</ref> Illyana's skill as a sorceress grows, and she battles other beings with mystical powers such as [[Baba Yaga]],<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #231</ref> the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]],<ref name=\"New Mutants SE\"/> [[Forge (comics)|Forge]],<ref name=\"NM66\">''The New Mutants'' #66. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]],<ref>''The New Mutants'' #65</ref> and Heka-Nut.<ref name=\"Arcanna\"/> A routine trip through Limbo goes awry, leaving the New Mutants stuck in Limbo. To open an escape route for her teammates, Illyana embraces her demonic nature and opens a colossal teleportation disc between Earth and Limbo, which [[N'astirh]] holds open, triggering [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|an invasion of Earth by demons from Limbo]].<ref>''The New Mutants'' #70-71. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ashamed of herself, she flees into Limbo, and decides to end the demonic invasion by assuming rule of Limbo. However, her teammate [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]] persuades her against this, and she instead gives up her demonic powers by creating a massive stepping disc that banishes the demons back to Limbo, then throws her Soulsword in after them to seal the portal shut. Afterwards, the New Mutants find a seven-year-old Illyana inside the husk of her eldritch armor. She still possesses the bloodstone locket.<ref name=\"NM73\">''The New Mutants'' #73. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Because of the mystic bond she shares with the Shadowcat from the Limbo dimension, the Soulsword passes on to Earth's Shadowcat in England. It embeds itself in a stone near [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'s lighthouse headquarters, waiting for Shadowcat to claim it and become its new wielder.<ref>''Excalibur'' #11 (1989)</ref> After a conflict with the necromancer Gravemoss, the Soulsword is acquired by [[Amanda Sefton]],<ref>''Excalibur'' #83-85 (1994-1995)</ref> who would claim Illyana's mantle as Magik, ruler of Limbo and wielder of the Soulsword.<ref>''X-Men: Magik'' #1 (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Illyana returns to Russia where she lives with her parents for some months until they are murdered by the Russian government to secure Illyana's abilities to defeat a psionic being known as the [[Soul Skinner]]. Illyana then returns to the [[X-Mansion]] to live with her brother and the other X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #17-18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Not long afterwards, Illyana contracts the [[Legacy Virus]], and dies in the X-Mansion, despite all efforts to save her made by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and [[Moira MacTaggert]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #303. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Illyana's spirit returns<ref name=autogenerated13>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #365. Marvel Comics.</ref> to Colossus, who had recently returned to the United States with Shadowcat and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] following the disbanding of Excalibur. When investigating odd occurrences inside the Mansion, Colossus locates one of the stepping disks that Illyana had magically bound to the school. He is transported to a pocket world, which holds a memory imprint of Illyana.<ref name=autogenerated13/> Illyana's memory convinces him to make one final sacrifice. When the cure for the Legacy Virus turned out to need the death of one mutant, he secretly gave his life, so nobody else would have to die like Illyana did.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #390. Marvel Comics.</ref> Colossus is later resurrected by an alien race.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #5 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Belasco eventually deposes Amanda Sefton and, after seeing Illyana reappear during the 2005 \"[[House of M]]\" and realizing he carries a torch for her, creates a powerful spell to return her to him. The spell pulls forth the remaining essence of Illyana still held within Limbo's dimension, taking shape as the Darkchilde, the semi-demonic version of Illyana corrupted and transformed by dark magic. Belasco is not satisfied with his creation, claiming that it is not the true Illyana Rasputin (due to her lack of Illyana's soul) and banishes her to the outer parts of Limbo.<ref name=\"New41\">''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Illyana, now with her Darkchilde persona, discovers some of the teenage [[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]] being attacked by a horde of demons. After aiding the mutants against the demons, she uses a spell to immobilize them and steal a portion of [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]]'s soul, in the hopes of creating both a bloodstone and a new Soulsword, as Illyana felt Pixie had the most innocent of souls present. [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] breaks free from Illyana's confinement and dispatches her. Pixie's soul extraction is partially successful however, creating one part of a bloodstone pendant and a soul dagger. Illyana attempts to complete the process and destroy those who wished to interfere, but [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] thwarts her, and causes Illyana's human memories of her friends and life among the X-Men to return to her.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #40. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although only a part of Pixie's soul was taken, Pixie is now capable of performing magic, the hole in her soul having been filled with [[black magic]]. Since Belasco had sealed his castle from her own magic and powers, Illyana teaches Pixie a [[teleportation]] spell, with which the New X-Men attack and defeat Belasco.<ref name=\"New41\"/>

Illyana succumbs to her Darkchilde persona and announces her desire to create several more bloodstones to become god-like in power. She is interrupted by the arrival of Colossus, investigating Illyana's apparent return to life. A pained Illyana rejects her brother's offers of help, and sends everyone back to Earth, before reclaiming Limbo's throne and informing S'ym and N'astirh, now once more her servants, that her next move is to reclaim her soul.<ref name=\"New41\"/> Motivated by her friendship with Shadowcat and love for Colossus, Illyana tries to reclaim her soul through love and teleports to the Xavier Institute, only to find it destroyed and abandoned.<ref>''X-Men: Divided We Stand'' #2 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

While in Limbo, Illyana attacks various demons in her search for the Bloodstone amulet. Her activities are noticed by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Satannish]], [[Dormammu]] and [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Belasco's daughter, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] appears during the meeting and reveals she is the current owner of Illyana's Bloodstone amulet and vows to take her father's place as ruler of Limbo. Back at the X-Men's base in San Francisco, Pixie accidentally discovers Magik's Soulsword is hidden inside Nightcrawler. Sensing its presence, Illyana teleports in and reclaims her sword, transforming from the Darkchilde into her Magik persona.<ref>''[[X-Infernus]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She strikes Colossus when he enters the Danger Room and calls out to her, realizing that something is wrong when she does not feel any emotions, and returns to Limbo. Witchfire has conquered Limbo and Magik's armies during her absence.<ref name=\"Infernus2\">''X-Infernus'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Claiming everything that Belasco ever owned, Witchfire captures Magik, takes her bloodstone and adds it to the amulet.

The X-Men arrive at the castle; Nightcrawler finds Illyana chained to a pillar. At her direction, he stabs her with Pixie's soul dagger, re-releasing the Soulsword inside of her. Witchfire completes the set of Bloodstones via another portion of Pixie's soul and releases the Elder Gods.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #3</ref> Illyana and the other mutants hold back Witchfire and the Elder Gods. Using a combination of magic and the powers of the Soulsword and Souldagger, Illyana and Pixie remove one of Pixie's bloodstones. The Elder Gods are swept back to their dimension, along with Witchfire and the remaining bloodstones. Pixie's Souldagger merges with the bloodstone that was pried loose by Ilyana. Saddened by the loss of her and Pixie's remaining bloodstones, Illyana teleports the mutants back to the X-Base, and they convince her to stay with them.<ref name=\"Infernus4\">''X-Infernus'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, the younger mutants are still very distrustful of her. Illyana seems to have undergone a personality change since her return from the future, becoming more detached emotionally in most cases, possibly due to the further loss of most of her soul.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Cyclops sends Illyana to team up (unknowingly) with X-Force to locate Wolverine and teleport them to Alcatraz to rescue any mutants taken prisoner by Norman Osborn's forces. Along with Pixie, they teleport all the X-Men from San Francisco to their new home, Utopia.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] return to the present during the 2010 \"[[X-Men: Second Coming]]\" storyline, [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] begins eliminating all mutant teleporters to trap the mutant population on Utopia. While trying to bring Hope and Cable to Utopia, Illyana is fired upon by one of the Purifiers with a supernatural weapon that opens a portal to Limbo that she cannot control; she is drawn into the portal by a cluster of demonic tentacles.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is eventually freed from her restraints by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], and Illyana and her rescue team return to Earth.<ref>''X-Men Second Coming - Revelations: Hellbound'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a reversal of fortune, Pixie is kidnapped by [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)#Project Purgatory/ Inferno Babies Members|Project Purgatory]], and Magik returns to Limbo with the New Mutants to rescue her.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> While in Limbo, the New Mutants encounter the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)#Project Purgatory/ Inferno Babies Members|''Inferno Babies'']] - mutants who were taken as infants by the government and raised and trained in Limbo.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> This now-adult team attacks and overwhelms the New Mutants. While the rest of the team is captured, Magik escapes to Earth with [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and Pixie. After hiding the Soulsword inside Karma, Magik teleports the rest of the X-Men to Portal Epsilon, Project Purgatory's gateway to Limbo, for what the X-Men believe to be a rescue mission. They arrive just as Limbo's Elder Gods breach the gateway to Earth.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Karma releases [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]'s mind with the soulsword, freeing him to use his powers to destroy the Elder Gods and return the bloodstones belonging to Magik and Pixie, thus restoring their souls.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> Confronted by Cyclops afterward, Magik admits to putting the world in danger and manipulating the X-Men for the sake of a personal vendetta against the Elder Gods. Cyclops decides that she must be restrained. While she remains unrepentant, she accepts his decision.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Magik is placed in the X-Brig 2, a newly constructed, ultra-high security prison 500&nbsp;ft. below sea level. She is controlled by devices that detect and prevent the use of teleportation and magic. During a visit Magik accepts the blame for her incarceration when Colossus tries to comfort her. Magik is temporarily released by Colossus and Kitty to get her help in defeating [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #540. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the events of [[X-Men: Schism|Schism]], Magik is selected to be a member of Cyclops' \"Extinction Team.\"<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol 2. #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite this status, she remains a prisoner. She is only released from the X-Brig for missions, and while in the field, her suit contains lethal fail-safes that prevent her escape.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

They fight back and Illyana absorbs all of Limbo's mystic energy, causing it and its creatures to disappear. She sends the X-Men back to Earth, and travels back through time to become the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a past version of [[Doctor Strange]], explaining that she needs a greater understanding of magic, so as to better control her mutant powers.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is eventually discovered that Magik along with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magneto and Colossus were actually infected with nano-sentinels by Dark Beast, after the incident with the Phoenix Force, and that was the real cause for their broken powers or sudden upgrade.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> She has since regained total control over her powers and was able to recreate Limbo.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

She later helps Doctor Strange defeat the Empirikul, a science cult focused on destroying magic in every dimension.<ref>''[[Dr. Strange: Last Days of Magic]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When an eco-terrorist group attempted to use the [[Man-Thing]] as a weapon against humanity, the part of Ted Sallis within the creature attempted to stop the threat by summoning the demon lord Belasco, who he had previously made a deal with to gain the insight necessary to crack the super-soldier serum. Instead, this ritual summoned Illyana, who offered to release Sallis from the Man-Thing with the warning that this would leave Man-Thing a creature of instinct who could endanger the world. Sallis accepted that he had to remain in Man-Thing, but Illyana not only helped stop the group that had unleashed Man-Thing as a weapon, but later summoned Belasco so that Sallis could punish the demon for his role in Sallis's fall.<ref>''X-Men: Curse of the Man-Thing''</ref>

===Dawn of X===
After the formation of the mutant sovereign state of Krakoa, Magik is granted the rank of Captain in the Quiet Council. She joins Sunspot and the other New Mutants in travelling to Shi'ar space, aboard the Starjammers vessel, to locate Sunspot's best friend Cannonball.

===Teleportation===
Magik has the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others through time and space from one location to another.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harth |first=David |date=2020-01-16 |title=The New Mutants: 10 Things You Never Knew About Magik |url=https://www.cbr.com/the-new-mutants-facts-about-magik/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>  She initially did this by summoning what she calls \"stepping discs,\" which were part of a dimension known as [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. Claremont wrote dialogue for Kitty Pryde that identified Magik's powers with science fiction author [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space#Stepping disks|stepping disks]], a concept that first appeared in his 1970 novel ''[[Ringworld]]''.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160</ref><ref name=\"Schlesinger\">{{Cite web |last=Schlesinger |first=Alex |date=2022-08-26 |title=Marvel Finally Answers a Decades Old X-Men Mystery |url=https://screenrant.com/xmen-new-mutants-magik-teleportation-powers-explained/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

When Illyana called for a stepping disc she had to use Limbo as a midway point before she could teleport to an alternate location. Magik has succeeded in teleporting herself across continents, from one continent to another, and even interplanetary and intergalactic distances on occasion.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #68-70</ref>

Unlike most teleporters in the Marvel Universe, Magik can teleport through time as well as space. She has teleported moments, days or centuries into the past or future.<ref name=\"Arcanna\"/><ref>''The New Mutants'' #49</ref><ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/> Especially early on, she had difficulty modulating this ability and would often inadvertently travel through time and space when intending to teleport only through space.<ref name=\"Arcanna\" /><ref name=\"New Mutants SE\">''The New Mutants Special Edition'' #1</ref> The greater the distance over which she teleported, the greater the possible margin of error in terms of her arriving at the point of time she intended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

After Illyana absorbed all of Limbo, the stepping discs ceased to exist; now when Illyana teleports, hellish images of ghosts, dragons, or other supernatural creatures appear.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #8</ref>

===Sorcery===
Magik is the sorceress supreme of her Limbo dimension.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McGuire |first=Liam |date=2021-09-27 |title=Marvel Confirms Magik As A New Sorcerer Supreme |url=https://screenrant.com/magic-sorcerer-supreme-limbo-marvel-comics-confirmed/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

In Limbo, Magik is able to cast any magic spell that Belasco could, having had access to his store of sorcerous knowledge. Her sorcery is a unique mix of black magic that she learned from Belasco and white magic she was taught by an alternative-reality [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]].<ref name=\"Austin\">{{Cite web |last=Austin |first=Michael |date=2019-10-04 |title=X-Men: 10 Of Magik's Most Powerful Abilities, Finally Explained |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-magik-strongest-most-powerful-abilities-explained/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

On Earth, her magic was limited to [[astral projection]], sensing mystical presences, [[scrying]], and casting very simple spells.<ref name=\"Austin\"/><ref name=\"Ukil\">{{Cite web |last=Ukil |first=Aparna |title=From Doctor Strange to Enchantress: 5 most powerful comic characters with magic abilities |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/comics/from-doctor-strange-enchantress-5-powerful-comic-characters-magic-abilities |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=www.sportskeeda.com |language=en-us}}</ref> In ''X-Infernus'', she uses magic of a seemingly greater strength than she could previously use in Earth's dimension.<ref name=\"Infernus2\"/> Since absorbing Limbo and becoming Doctor Strange's disciple, Illyana's magic on Earth has been considerably stronger, such as when she used spells she learned from Doctor Strange to destroy advanced [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #19</ref>

====Eldritch armor====
[[Image:ArmorIllyana.jpg|thumb|right|Illyana, willing most of her armor to appear. Art by [[Bret Blevins]].]]
The more Magik uses her magical power, the more mystical armor appears on her body, in addition to demonic features such as horns and hooves. The armor deflects or limits attacks, both physical and magical.<ref name=\"NM66\"/> Illyana's armor also provides protection from the [[techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]].<ref name=\"NM73\"/> The armor also provides Illyana with super-strength, which she displayed by being able to toss the giant demon S'ym off of her several feet.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #73</ref>

====Soulsword====
The Soulsword was created by Illyana Rasputin during her imprisonment in Limbo. Illyana magically caused her own life force energy to manifest before her. Once this happened she cast her hand into a pool of eldritch energy and imagined a weapon in her mind. When she withdrew her hand she was holding the Soulsword, created from her own soul.<ref name=\"MIS4\"/> A simple looking blade upon its origin, it develops intricate designs and forms upon itself the more Illyana uses it, becoming more powerful with each use.<ref name=\"NM50\">''The New Mutants'' #50</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Connolly |first=Spencer |date=2020-12-01 |title=Is The Soulsword Marvel's Most Powerful Weapon? |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-most-powerful-weapon-soulsword-magik-xmen-mutants/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

Magik's Soulsword disrupts magical energies, constructs, and creatures. It also augments the power level of any magic user who holds it.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kogod |first=Theo |date=2020-11-18 |title=X Of Swords: Every Sword The X-Men Use, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-of-swords-every-sword-x-men-use-ranked/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> The Soulsword generally has no physical effect, but disrupts even the most powerful magic as it passes through. Since Illyana's resurrection, the Soulsword seems to affect psychic beings like Legion's personalities,<ref name=\"NMV4N3\">''New Mutants'' vol. 4 #3</ref> whereas in the past the sword only affected magical creatures and spells. The only exception to this has been [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]], who can still be cut by the Soulsword even when Pryde is using her phasing power to become intangible.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #171</ref> Illyana can make her Soulsword appear and vanish at will.<ref name=\"NMV4N3\"/> After ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'', Illyana has used her Soulsword against physical beings, including a Sentinel.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

===Other abilities===
Illyana has formidable psionic shields, which block anyone from reading her mind, even such powerful [[telepath]]s as [[Professor X]],<ref>''The New Mutants'' #14 and 50</ref> the [[Shadow King]],<ref>''The New Mutants'' #34</ref> and [[Rachel Summers]].<ref name=\"Xann9\">''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #9 (1985)</ref> Since her revival, Illyana is able to lower her psionic shields.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #9 (2010)</ref>

Due to Belasco creating the magical bloodstones with their souls, Illyana has a psychic bond with X-Man [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]].<ref name=\"Xann9\"/> Because of this, a similar connection could be considered between Illyana and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Magik'' #2</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Sara Century of ''[[Syfy]]'' referred to Magik as \"one of the X-Men's most surprisingly popular characters,\" asserting, \"Illyana's story often involves her teetering on the edge between good and evil. She is a character who has been forced to make no-win choices since her early childhood, and those decisions have gone on to define much of her arc. However, Illyana is also a brave, dynamic character whose hope was crushed out of her by a much older man when she was only a child. The trauma she underwent is extreme, even by X-Men standards. Though she finds her ability to hope has been crushed, Illyana's saving grace is that she does everything in her power to keep her friends safe from harm. No longer trusting herself, she surrounds herself with good people and puts her faith in them, instead. For anyone who has been made to feel like a lesser person for the abuse they've undergone, Illyana is a surprisingly poignant character. Her continuous struggle against her evil impulses might not always work out to everyone's advantage, but the fact that she continues to try even when all hope seems to be lost is still inspirational.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> David Harth of ''[[CBR.com]]'' labelled Magik as \"Marvel's best magic user,\" stating, \"Some Marvel heroes are vastly underrated and are deserving of more attention and time in the spotlight. Marvel's heroes run the gamut from the amazingly powerful to non-superpowered vigilantes. For years, the A-list heroes have fronted books and teams, their names becoming a part of the pantheon of greatest superheroes of all times. However, there are plenty of heroes out there who never got the chance to shine. These underrated heroes have vocal fans and are always on the cusp of stardom. [...] Magik has a long and storied history. A member of the powerful Rasputin family, Magik's teleportational abilities allow her to travel through space and time, but it's her magic powers that have made her so formidable. She's conquered the magical realm of Limbo and is a fearless combatant. She looks great, with her anime-inspired costume and giant swords making her a memorable visual. The magic side of Marvel is pretty much just her, Doctor Strange, and Scarlet Witch, and she's a more fun character than either of them. Magik has got it all: she's powerful, entertaining, looks cool, and can handle herself in battles against supervillains, demons, and dark gods.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harth |first=David |date=2022-01-01 |title=Marvel: The 10 Most Underrated Heroes, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-underrated-heroes-ranked/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Alex Schlesinger of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' wrote, \"The powerful mutant Magik, sister of the long time X-Men member Colossus, has not only seen a meteoric rise to fame over the past decade, but also has the best long-term character arc of any hero in Marvel Comics. First introduced in 1975's ''Giant-Size X-Men #1'' as the young, unnamed sister of Piotr Rasputin, Illyana was eventually kidnapped and brought to America by the villain Arcade before she was taken to the realm of Limbo by the evil demon lord Belasco. Since then Magik has dealt with the trauma she experienced at the hands of Belasco and his henchman S'ym in Limbo, losing her soul, and becoming the Queen of Limbo. [...] Magik's story powerfully shows that trauma is not necessary for growth or empowerment, but one can also not undo the trauma of their past. Instead, the path forward is to reconcile your past with your present and gain strength from the freedom you have desperately fought for. Magik's story of heroic redemption, escape from abuse, and acceptance of one's identity has given this X-Men fan-favorite the best character arc in Marvel Comics.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schlesinger |first=Alex |date=2022-09-03 |title=X-Men's Magik Has Marvel's Best Character Arc |url=https://screenrant.com/xmen-magik-illyana-rasputin-new-mutants-character-arc/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Michileen Martin of ''[[Looper (website)|Looper]]'' said, \"Illyana Rasputin, aka Magik, isn't quite like her New Mutants teammates. Yeah, she's a mutant, but her teleportation powers are just the beginning of her extraordinary abilities. Illyana is the earliest New Mutant to appear in the X-Men comics, showing up seven years before the New Mutants original graphic novel that introduced the team to readers. She's part-demon queen, a powerful sorceress, sister to a classic X-Men hero, and a star of 2020's superhero/horror hybrid The New Mutants. Plus, of the classic New Mutants line-up, she's proven the most willing to commit the kind of dark acts most superheroes shun. Over the years, Illyana has become a staple of the New Mutants. While not a founding member, once she joins, she's one of its most powerful assets and later proves an equally irreplaceable member of the X-Men. Unfortunately, the mystical origins of Illyana's powers occasionally threaten to make her a liability, as she's got a demonic dark half that's dangerously easy to corrupt. With both mutant and magical abilities, Illyana is a fascinating character.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Martin |first=Michileen |date=2020-01-31 |title=The Untold Truth Of Magik |url=https://www.looper.com/186267/the-untold-truth-of-magik/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

Matt Lune of ''[[CBR.com]]'' asserted, \"Sometimes there are issues of ''What If'' that are so outrageous, they'd never be possible in the regular canon. Other stories, however, take already established plotlines and give them a little tweak, then show us the Butterfly Effect that this small change causes. ''What If Magik'' #1 definitely falls into the latter category, giving us a look at the life of Illyana Rasputin had she walked away from the New Mutants at a pivotal moment. [...] There's so much to enjoy in this issue that it's a shame that it's out of continuity. Williams does an excellent job of using the somewhat reluctant pairing to enrich and deepen both central characters in a way that seems almost wasted in this one-off issue. If it weren't for the fact that this early time in Magik's life was already fully explored by Claremont, this would make a perfect retcon flashback that could set up a future relationship between Illyana and Strange. As it stands, this is an effective examination of the two characters in a way that manages to find new things to say about both of them.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lune |first=Matt |date=2018-11-06 |title=REVIEW: Illyana Fulfills Her Destiny in What If Magik #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/what-if-magik-1-review/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Jamie Lovett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''What If? Magik'' #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, saying, \"''What If? Magik'' packs a novel's worth of story into a single comic book. Leah Williams and Felipe Andrade use Magik's history to tell a story of trauma, abusive relationships, and the road to recovery and reclamation and it is exquisitely told. Williams knows exactly when to zoom into a moment with personal dialogue and when to zoom out to let the narration carry the reader. Andrade does a great job of building his layouts around the dialogue and narration. Both Williams writing and Andrade's artwork present strong characterizations of Magik and Doctor Strange. There are two small quibbles, however. Andrade's expressive faces sometimes verge on the cartoonish, which is at odds with the tone of the story. The issue also begs for one last splash page to really drive home just how far Illyanna has come by the end. Regardless, this is an expertly crafted single-issue tale.\"<ref>{{Cite web |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=31 October 2018 |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 10/31/2018 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/marvel-dc-image-comic-reviews-245359/ |access-date=12 September 2022 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref> Alan Kistler of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' included ''What If Magik'' #1 in their \"The greatest What If...? stories in Marvel history\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kistler |first=Alan |date=24 September 2019 |title=The greatest What If...? stories in Marvel history |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/24/20880521/best-marvel-what-if-comics-spider-man-wolverine-captain-america-hulk-mcu |access-date=3 December 2022 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' timeline, after Apocalypse's attacks on Russia, her friends and family believed that Illyana had died when in fact she was taken to the slave camp known as the Core located in Seattle, which provides energy for Apocalypse's empire. Colossus, Shadowcat and Generation NeXt rescue her, at the cost of the lives of every single member of Generation NeXt. Illyana then helps Bishop go back in time to prevent the Age of Apocalypse from occurring in the mainstream Earth-616 timeline.<ref>''X-Men: Omega''</ref> In the 2000 ''Blink'' limited series, it is revealed via flashback that [[Sugar Man]] was at one point the abusive jailer in charge of cellmates Illyana Rasputin and Blink (before she was rescued as a young girl by Weapon-X and Sabretooth) in a prison facility.<ref>''Blink'' #1-4 (2000)</ref>

===Excalibur===
During ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'''s \"Cross-Time Caper\" storyline, the team encounters a childlike version of Illyana, clothed in the regalia of Doctor Strange, who runs an organized crime cartel in partnership with her friend Shadowcat. When Alistaire Stuart and a near comatose Rachel Summers are threatened by the authorities, Illyana grants them sanctuary; however, she merely intends to use her guests in a bid for dominance over the world. When the authorities once more attempt to search Illyana's apartment, an altercation occurs and she is shot dead but merely resurrects into her fully demonic form. That world's [[Captain Britain]] and [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] arrive on the scene to help stop Illyana. Psylocke psychically restores [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]], who performs an exorcism on Illyana and restores her to her human state.<ref>''Excalibur'' #23</ref>

===Exiles===
Illyana from Earth-4210 is also a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|The Exiles]]. Illyana replaces [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] when the [[Timebroker]] sends her home. She is led to believe that had she not become an Exile, she would murder her family. This universe's Magik is much more temperamental and ruthless than the [[Earth-616]] Magik and clashes with the team from the beginning. Shortly after the Timebroker returns Blink to the team, he decrees that half the members of the combined Exiles and [[Weapon X]] group have to die. Fearing for her life, Magik tries to join [[Hyperion (comics)|King Hyperion]] and tells him of the mission Exiles and Weapon X were given. To corroborate her claims, Hyperion snaps Magik's neck to see if a replacement Exile is sent.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

===House of M===
Not a true alternate earth as such, [[House of M]] is a temporary recreation of Earth-616 by the [[Scarlet Witch]] in which mutants are dominant on Earth. Magik is a member of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squadron of young mutants called the Hellions. Like most of the other Hellions, she eventually joins the side of the New Mutants, a team being groomed as future leaders, in fighting the establishment of the House of M in [[Japan]]. This version of Magik teleports to Limbo before the Scarlet Witch restores reality to its former state.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #19</ref> This results in Belasco's resurrection of Illyana in Earth-616.{{issue|date=March 2022}} In this reality, she can speak Japanese.

===Shattershot===
In the Shattershot crossover, a reality was shown in which Illyana was regressed in the same way as in [[Earth-616]] but never succumbs to the Legacy Virus. She grows up to master her mutant and mystical powers, calls herself Darkchild and joins [[X-Force]] alongside [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]].<ref>''X-Force'' Annual #1</ref>

===Other===
In another reality in which Illyana is an adult, her son is trapped in an incorporeal form. She makes a deal with Mephisto to provide him with a body, at the cost of all mutants' lives, but her son ultimately rejects the offer.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #37</ref>

===What If?===
