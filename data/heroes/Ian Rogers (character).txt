'''Ian Rogers''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
While trapped in the mysterious Dimension Z, [[Captain America]] rescues '''Leopold Zola''', the infant son of [[Arnim Zola]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 7 #1</ref> Raising the child under the name \"Ian\", he manages to evade Zola's forces for eleven years, until Ian is accidentally shot and apparently killed by [[Sharon Carter]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 7 #8</ref> After Captain America escapes Dimension Z, Ian is revealed to have survived and taken up a costume and shield similar to that of his adoptive father. Now calling himself '''[[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]]''', Ian acts as the defender of Dimension Z.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 7 #10</ref> During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Nomad assists Steve Rogers and [[Spider-Man]] in rescuing [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] in Las Vegas.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #6</ref>

==Other versions==
* An alternate iteration has since been seen as the [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of the '''[[Red Skull]]''', the secret son of [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] and [[Gail Richards]]. This character was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Carlos Pacheco]], and first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' #1 (October 2009). He wears simple khaki pants and a white tee shirt.<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #2\"/> After his father's presumed death during World War II, he is taken from Gail and raised on an army base where he appears to be a well-adjusted, physically superior and tactically brilliant young man, but his easygoing personality was a ruse. At seventeen, he kills over 200 men on the base and then cuts off his own face in rejection of his father, leaving a \"red skull\".<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #2\">''Ultimate Avengers'' #2</ref> He assassinates President John F. Kennedy as a final symbol of his rebellion against the system, and had a long career of working as a professional assassin.<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #5\">''Ultimate Avengers'' #5</ref> Eventually, the Red Skull joins [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] so that he and his men can steal the Cosmic Cube's blueprints. There he finally meets Captain America and brutally beats his nemesis. Before throwing Captain America out of the helicopter, the Red Skull reveals his true identity. At A.I.M. headquarters in Alaska, the Red Skull kills the lead officer and takes charge of the operation. Now in control of the Cosmic Cube, he gains great power. As a sadistic display of his power, he has the entire A.I.M. team cannibalize each other. The Avengers arrive on the scene and immediately attack, but the Cosmic Cube imbues him with nearly unlimited power, making him absolutely invulnerable. Captain America arrives in a stolen fighter jet, but the Red Skull forces it to crash. The Captain survives the crash and teleports the jet to the Red Skull's exact coordinates, impaling him on one of the two rods that protrude from its nose.<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #6\">''Ultimate Avengers'' #6</ref> The Red Skull is taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for his mother's goodbyes. The Red Skull explains to [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was to turn back time and prevent his father from being lost, so that he could grow up with a normal life. He is killed when [[Petra Laskov]] (one of his victims) shoots him in the head. [[Gregory Stark]] implies that the Red Skull was called out of retirement in order for Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. position to be restored.<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #6\"/>
* During the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' crossover event, a version of Leopard Zola appears as '''Captain Hydra''' in a warzone where [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] has been in power and in New York City. Captain Hydra later fights his main counterpart.<ref>''Hail Hydra'' #1-4</ref>

==In other media==
* A character named '''James Rogers''' appears in the animated film ''[[Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow]]'' (2008), voiced by [[Noah Crawford]]. He is the son of Steve Rogers and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]].
* A variation of Captain Hydra appears in the animated film ''[[Heroes United|Iron Man and Captain America: Heroes United]]'' (2014), in which Steve Rogers (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]]) is brainwashed.
