'''Onyxx''' ('''Sidney Green''') is a [[fictional]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'', vol. 2 #171 and was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Salvador Larroca]].

==Fictional character biography==
Onyxx passes from various foster homes and orphanages, unable to find acceptance because of his crude behavior<ref name=\"files\">198 Files</ref> and chronic [[bedwetting]].  Much to his delight, this chronic condition is cured when he mutates into the huge, hulking rock-like form we know him as today.  

Onyxx becomes a student at the Xavier Institute, assigned to [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit's]] training squad, the Chevaliers.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'', vol. 13 (2010)</ref> Onyxx has a romantic interest in a new student at the Institute by the named Foxx. It is later revealed that Foxx is actually a longtime adversary, Mystique, one of the [[X-Men]].. She infiltrates the school to destabilize the relationship between Gambit and her foster daughter, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. After having revealed herself to the X-Men, Onyxx attacks Mystique for not returning his affection. Mystique escapes and, with the help of an accomplice, injures Onyxx.

Onyxx's fellow student [[Bling (comics)|Bling]] is also attracted to Foxx, and their shared infatuation may be the basis of a friendship, since the two are often seen together. Bling once refers to Onyxx as \"Randy,\" which could be interpreted as a playful nickname (\"randy\" being a synonym for \"horny\") but is more likely a writer's error.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #35</ref>

===Decimation===
Sidney retains his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and continues residing at the school. Onyxx is critically injured by [[William Stryker|Reverend Stryker]] during his attack on the institute; barely surviving. Onyxx is later captured alongside his fellow students in [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #38</ref> He is usually shown in the company of Bling.  He lives at the Xavier Institute in [[San Francisco]].<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3</ref>

===Utopia===
Onyxx, along with fellow students [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] and [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], is tasked with keeping peace at the riots on [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]]. This is after the mutant-hate group \"Humanity Now!\" marches from Sacramento to San Francisco to promote \"Proposition X\", displeasing many citizens of San Francisco, mutant and non-mutant alike. After the riots subside on Telegraph Hill, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] comes and picks them up, taking them to City Hall.<ref>''Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref> He is also seen in the company of [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]] when she arrives to pick up an injured [[Trance (comics)|Trance]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226</ref>

===Necrosha and Death===
Onyxx is seen amongst those under attack by Selene's new Inner Circle of death mutants on Utopia. Onyxx tries to sneak attack [[Wither (comics)|Wither]] while he is distracted by [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], but Wither catches him and disintegrates him into rubble apparently killing him. He and the mutant Diamond Lil were casualties in Selene's attempt to gain a mystically charged knife.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 3 #23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Onyxx has a craggy [[granite]] body, which gives him superhuman strength and greater resistance to physical injury. He has also been seen to have a second pair of eyes, but it is unknown if these serve any special purpose.
