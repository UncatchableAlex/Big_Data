==Concept and creation==
[[Marvel Comics]]' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978, shortly after Spider-Woman's debut in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #32 (February 1977) and the start of the character's 50-issue, self-titled series (April 1978 - June 1983), that the character originated because
{{bquote|I suddenly realized that some other company may quickly put out a book like that and claim they have the right to use the name, and I thought we'd better do it real fast to copyright the name. So we just batted one quickly, and that's exactly what happened. I wanted to protect the name, because it's the type of thing [where] someone else might say, 'Hey, why don't we put out a Spider-Woman; they can't stop us.' ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[DC Comics]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got [[Power Girl]] [after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Oh, boy. How unfair.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Map Raps with Marvel Maniacs at [[James Madison University]] | work = [[The Comics Journal]] | issue = 42 | date = October 1978 | page = 55}}</ref>}}

Spider-Woman's origin and basic character were designed by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], while her visual appearance was designed by freelancer [[Marie Severin]].<ref name=\"Back17\">{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2006|title= Marvel's Dark Angel: ''Back Issue'' Gets Caught in Spider-Woman's Web|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 17|pages= 57\u201363|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Publication history==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Spider-Woman v1 1.png|thumb|upright|left|''Spider-Woman'' #1 (April 1978). Cover art by [[Joe Sinnott]].]] -->

===Original series===
Though by most accounts, Spider-Woman was originally intended as a one-off character for the sake of simply establishing trademark, ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 sold unexpectedly well and writer/editor [[Marv Wolfman]] was asked to take the character to an ongoing series.<ref name=\"Back17\" />

In her first appearance, Spider-Woman was to be an actual spider evolved into a human as imagined by writer/co-creator Goodwin.<ref name=\"CBRorigin\" /> Her debut was shortly followed by a four-issue story arc in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' in which Wolfman presented a different origin [[retcon]] as he felt her original origin was too implausible for mid-1970s readers.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> During this arc and the premiere issue of her own comic, Spider-Woman was identified as the human, Jessica Drew (combining the first name of Wolfman's daughter and the last name of fictional detective [[Nancy Drew]]<ref name=\"Back17\" />), who had memories of being a spider implanted into her by the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. Her costume was also redesigned for her series so that her long hair was uncovered, becoming a prominent part of the character's appearance.

[[File:Reflective scene Spider-Woman 2.jpeg|thumb|Jessica Drew's feelings of isolation from other people were a major theme of the first year and a half of her series. Scene from ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978); story by [[Marv Wolfman]], pencils by [[Carmine Infantino]], inks by [[Tony DeZuniga]].]]
Wolfman introduced Spider-Woman's mentor [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Charles Magnus]] and archenemies [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] and the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]]. He left the series after issue #8, citing a heavy workload,<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #8 and 12.</ref> but later admitted \"If truth be told, I never felt comfortable writing her. I never found a handle for her and kept trying until I finally decided to leave the book\".<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Neophyte [[Mark Gruenwald]] became the writer, while the series's regular penciler, comics legend [[Carmine Infantino]], remained on board, having developed a fondness for the character and her stories.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Gruenwald continued with the macabre themes Wolfman had used, while putting more focus on Drew's struggles to deal with her social awkwardness, shyness, and the negative reactions she produced in nearly everyone she met. The last of these is revealed to be caused by fear-inducing pheromones, a previously unrevealed ability. Gruenwald also introduced outgoing aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe, who became Drew's best friend and the mainstay of her supporting cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/without-a-trace-15-missing-marvel-characters/|title=Without a Trace: 15 Missing Marvel Characters|last=Cronin|first=Brian|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 18, 2017|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004104702/http://www.cbr.com/without-a-trace-15-missing-marvel-characters/|archive-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Marvel had been heavily advertising the series from the start, and during Gruenwald's run [[Spider-Woman (TV series)|an animated TV series]] began airing. But [[Roger Stern]], who replaced Wolfman as editor, recounted that Spider-Woman had already lost her status as a top seller by this time. Despite her differing origin and powers and Wolfman's deliberate effort to avoid Spider-Man guest appearances or crossovers, readers still tended to see the character as a female Spider-Man. \"They saw her, and later the She-Hulk\", Stern explained, \"as running a good idea into the ground, much as DC had done in the \u201960s with its then-ever-growing families of Super- and Bat-characters\".<ref name=\"Back17\" />

Issue #20 saw the departure of Gruenwald, Infantino, and Stern. New writer [[Michael Fleisher]] gave Spider-Woman a career as a bounty hunter, abandoned both the series' macabre tone and outstanding subplots such as Charles Magnus' mysterious disappearance, and replaced them with such superhero standbys as criminal masterminds and a love interest who is enamored with the protagonist's costumed guise but oblivious to her in her civilian identity. Many fans criticized that Fleisher had taken away everything that made the character special.<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #27-28.</ref> Fleisher would be retained on the series up until #32, after which [[Chris Claremont]], already a big-name writer for his work on ''Uncanny X-Men'', took over and switched Jessica Drew's occupation from bounty hunter to private investigator. [[Steve Leialoha]] was drawing the series by this time.

The series had already come under criticism for its rapid turnover of writers,<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #33.</ref> and like all of its writers, Claremont had a fairly short stay on ''Spider-Woman''. After 13 issues, both he and Leialoha were compelled to leave for other projects.<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #46.</ref> Their final issue marked the return of Gruenwald, this time as editor. He was promptly informed that due to dwindling sales, Marvel was canceling the series, and issue #50 would be the last.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-spider-womans-dead-and-forgotten/|title=The Abandoned An' Forsaked \u2013 Spider-Woman's Dead and Forgotten?!?|first=Brian | last= Cronin|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 11, 2012|access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref> Gruenwald hired comic book novices [[Ann Nocenti]] and Brian Postman as writer and penciler for the final four issues, under the theory that their inexperience in the medium would give them a unique perspective and perhaps take the series out with a bang.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Under Gruenwald's direction, the series returned to its macabre roots and resumed the long-abandoned subplot of Magnus's disappearance. The final issue used a photo cover of Marvel staffers (including Gruenwald and Nocenti) in costume as the issue's cast,<ref name=\"Back17\" /> and had Spider-Woman perish in a climactic battle with her nemesis Morgan le Fay. Nocenti reasoned, \"These are licensed characters and you want them to have a forever life. At the same time, they live in a violent world and occasionally you feel like someone has to die, otherwise it\u2019s too unreal\".<ref name=\"Back17\" />

Readers were outraged at the character being killed, and Nocenti and Gruenwald both came to feel remorse over their decision.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Gruenwald took the readers' reaction especially to heart, and became determined to fix what he saw as a major mistake. He and Stern had been paired up again on ''Avengers'', but with their jobs swapped, and he instructed Stern to write a story reviving Drew.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Less than a year after her death, Spider-Woman was resurrected in ''The Avengers'' #240-241 (Feb.-March 1984).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/10-marvel-heroes-who-quit-and-returned|title=10 Marvel Heroes Who Quit and Returned|last=Marnell|first=Blair|website=Marvel|date=May 30, 2019|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135751/https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/10-marvel-heroes-who-quit-and-returned|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Decline===
For the next four years she was limited to a handful of guest appearances. In 1988, she and Lindsay McCabe joined the supporting cast of ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', appearing through the first 16 issues of the character's series, followed by brief returns in issues #27 and 125-128. She was never depicted in costume during her appearances in ''Wolverine'', sticking with her civilian identity, though she did often use her powers to aid Wolverine.<ref name=\"CBRwolverine\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/wolverine-superheroes-best-friends-deadpool-nightcrawler/|title=Wolverine: 15 Superheroes You Didn't Know He Was Best Friends With - 12|last=Blunden|first=Fred|publisher=[[ScreenRant]]|date=February 19, 2017|access-date=May 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204211004/https://screenrant.com/wolverine-superheroes-best-friends-deadpool-nightcrawler/|archive-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

In 1996, Mark Gruenwald returned to the character with a short back-up feature in ''Sensational Spider-Man Annual'' '96. Titled \"The Return of Spider-Woman\", it put Drew back in costume for the first time in over a decade and ended with a teaser for further Spider-Woman adventures in ''Spider-Man Team Up''. Gruenwald died, however, before these stories could be written, and subsequent appearances treated \"The Return of Spider-Woman\" as non-canon. In 1999, Drew was again placed in the role of non-costumed supporting character, this time to the third Spider-Woman, [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]], for the first 11 issues of ''Spider-Woman'' volume 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|title=The Replacements: Jessica Drew And The Legacy Of Spider-Woman|last=Shiach|first=Kieran|publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]]|date=August 25, 2016|access-date=May 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009124344/http://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|archive-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref>

Drew made an appearance in a 2003 story arc in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', a series written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/11/02/jessica-jones-the-alias-reread-part-3/|title=Jessica Jones: The Alias Reread Part 3|last=Roberts|first=Tansy Rayner|website=[[Tor.com|Tor]]|date=November 2, 2015|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702174930/https://www.tor.com/2015/11/02/jessica-jones-the-alias-reread-part-3/|archive-date=July 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Bendis would write most of the character's adventures for the next decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsverse.com/spider-woman-jessica-drew-podcast/|title=Episode 114: Why Spider-Woman Should Be Marvel's Next Big Female Superhero|last=Camau|first=Jesse|website=ComicsVerse|date=May 31, 2019|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608143044/https://comicsverse.com/spider-woman-jessica-drew-podcast/|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Revival through New Avengers===
In January 2005, ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' was launched, ostensibly with Jessica Drew as a member of the titular supergroup, back in costume as Spider-Woman. Though this Jessica Drew would later be revealed as an imposter, this prominent exposure of the character opened the door for new attention to her original adventures. Firstly, on 21 December 2005, Marvel released the first issue of ''Spider-Woman: Origin,'' a five-part miniseries co-written by Brian Michael Bendis and Brian Reed, illustrated by the art team of the [[Luna Brothers]], Jonathan and Joshua Luna. It was largely an extended retelling of ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32, though some details were changed.<ref name=\"CBRorigin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|title=Just What Is Spider-Woman's Origin?|last=Cronin|first=Brian|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=January 11, 2017|access-date=May 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114405/https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|archive-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref>

Secondly, the original ''Spider-Woman'' series was reprinted in its entirety, along with ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 and all her contemporaneous guest appearances, in a pair of ''Essentials'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s, the first released simultaneously with ''Spider-Woman: Origin'' #1, the second in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/title/comics/essential_spider_woman.html|title=Essential Spider-Woman - reprints|website=Spiderfan|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323060159/http://www.spiderfan.org/title/comics/essential_spider_woman.html|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2009, the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline introduced the concept that, with the exception of some flashback scenes, all of Jessica Drew's appearances in ''New Avengers'' over the past four years were actually made by a [[Skrull]] imposter. Writer Bendis said he had this planned since ''New Avengers'' #1. 
{{quote|You can go back to issue #1 and see hints. [...] Now you know why the ''Spider-Woman'' series didn't happen. We thought about doing it and having her revealed as a Skrull in the first issue of her series. [...] I wrote it, but in the end I just thought it wasn't selling somebody what they thought you were selling them.<ref>{{cite web | date = June 4, 2008 | author = David Richards |title= Spoilers of War: Secret Invasion #3 |url= https://www.cbr.com/spoilers-of-war-secret-invasion-3/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210125035202/https://www.cbr.com/spoilers-of-war-secret-invasion-3/ | archive-date = 2008-10-11 |publisher= Comic Book Resources |access-date= 2021-01-25 }}</ref>}}

Following this story, the real Drew supplanted her doppelganger as a regular member of The New Avengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=97742|title=MEET THE [new] NEW AVENGERS: DAY 5 - Jessica Drew|last=Brady|first=Matt|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=January 16, 2007|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203140743/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=97742|archive-date=February 3, 2009}}</ref> She was also featured in [[Spider-Woman (2009 series)|another solo limited series]] during this time, which was published both in printed form and as a [[motion comic]].

===''Spider-Verse'' and a new solo series===
In 2014, Jessica was a key player in the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' event. Spinning out of that event, a new fifth volume ''Spider-Woman'' series was started, written by [[Dennis Hopeless]]. In issue #5 the series featured the first redesign of Jessica's costume since it was created in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23037-spider-woman-gets-a-new-costume.html|title=SPIDER-WOMAN Gets a New Costume|last=Doran|first=Michael|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=December 18, 2014|access-date= May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704234333/https://www.newsarama.com/23037-spider-woman-gets-a-new-costume.html|archive-date=July 4, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This series was interrupted by Marvel's 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event, and ended with issue #10.

==Fictional character biography==
{{overly detailed|section=y|date=March 2015}}

===Origins===
Spider-Woman was born Jessica Miriam Drew, daughter of Jonathan Drew and Merriam Drew, in [[London]], [[England]]. At a young age, her family moves to a lab built by her father and [[High Evolutionary|Herbert Wyndham]] near [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], where she becomes gravely ill from months of uranium exposure. To save her life, her father injects her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders' blood. Because the serum requires a month's incubation, Wyndham places her in a genetic accelerator. Shortly after, her mother dies and her father leaves for the United States, leaving Wyndham to care for her.<ref name=\"SW1\">''Spider-Woman'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While in the accelerator, she ages at a decelerated rate. When she is finally released, decades later, Drew is only 17 years old.

Drew is ostracized by the other residents of Mount Wundagore, the High Evolutionary's [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]], since she was originally human while they were animals. Because of this, she eventually leaves to seek human civilization. She is captured by a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] reserve unit under [[Count Otto Vermis]]'s leadership who erases her memories, brainwashes her, and recruits her as a HYDRA agent under the codename Arachne.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> One of HYDRA's top agents, Jared, is assigned to train her in combat and espionage and to seduce her. Once Jessica has become his lover, he allows himself to be captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] so that she can be goaded into assassinating S.H.I.E.L.D. commander [[Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"debut\">''Marvel Spotlight'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While battling Fury, Jessica accidentally kills Jared and learns HYDRA's true nature. She quits HYDRA and assaults the unit's base, sending Count Vermis into a fatal crash, but not before he unlocks memory implants that she was actually an evolved spider and had killed a man before her association with HYDRA.<ref name=\"debut\" /> Despondent from these revelations, she wanders the woods where Vermis crashed until being recaptured and hypnotized by HYDRA.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====''Spider-Woman: Origin''====
''Origin'' does away with the spider-blood serum and genetic accelerator elements of the character's previous origin story. Instead, Jessica's powers derive from her mother's womb being hit by a laser beam containing the DNA traits of several different species of spiders while she was carrying Jessica (the Drews were trying to splice and harness spiders' environmental adaptive capabilities to graft them into the human genome).<ref name=\"SWorigin1\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' #1 (February 2006). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref><ref name=\"SWorigin3\">''Spider-Woman Origin' #3 (April 2006). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

After Jessica's parents disappear under mysterious circumstances, Jessica is recruited into HYDRA (under false pretenses), where she is made into a formidable fighter and assassin. She is trained and mentored by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who trains her in many martial disciplines and more than seven different fighting styles out of his own \"arsenal\".<ref name=\"SWorigin2\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' #2 (March 2006). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In this re-telling, Otto Vermis, originally recruiting her into HYDRA, is rather an old, retired HYDRA agent whom Jessica seduces to gain information that will lead her to her father.<ref name=\"SWorigin4\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' #4 (May 2006). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In addition, ''Origin'' made the following modifications:
* Merriam Drew was now Miriam Drew.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />
* The Drews moved to Wundagore Mountain prior to Jessica's conception, establishing without a doubt that she was born on the European landmark. Afterwards, she was raised by her nanny [[Bova (comics)|Bova]] (human in appearance), as well as her mother.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />
* Jessica's father, Jonathan, never found uranium on their land. Instead, their research was funded by HYDRA, and their direct liaison/financier from the group was General Wyndham. It is not clear what connection, if any, he had with Edgar Wyndham (who, in the original Spider-Woman books, was Jonathan's best friend and research partner), nor with the High Evolutionary.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />
* Jessica's father worked in large part with [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] who later left the project because he felt that there was more potential in experimenting with the [[Clone Saga|cloning]] of human cells.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />

===Spider-Woman===
As Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew is ordered to abduct [[Alicia Masters]] vacationing in London. During the resultant conflict with [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], she recovers from her brainwashing and joins him in saving Masters.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #30\u201332. Marvel Comics.</ref> She and Grimm then encounter [[Modred the Mystic]], who removes HYDRA's memory implants and restores her memories.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jessica moves into an apartment in London, but finds it impossible to get a job due to her complete lack of background and her tendency to inspire dislike and even fear in other people. Following an aborted break-in, she is unmasked by [[Scotland Yard]] officer (and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) Jerry Hunt, who becomes obsessed with her.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> During this troubled time, she is approached by the mysterious sorcerer [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]], who offers help. After defending him from Excaliber, who was sent by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] to recover the [[Darkhold]], he suggests that she relocate with him to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magnus tutors her in the ways of civilization and informs her that her father was murdered, leading her on a hunt for his killer.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #3\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is distracted from this hunt when Morgan Le Fey's ghost again seeks the Darkhold, this time in person. During the battle, Hunt catches up with Jessica and they begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5\u20136. Marvel Comics.</ref> With his help, she identifies her father's murderer who dies immediately after confessing.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For the time, Jessica chooses to keep her doings as Spider-Woman a secret. Her relationship with Hunt sours, and following a final battle with the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], he and Magnus part ways with her.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #12\u201313, 16. Marvel Comics.</ref> For the next three months, she makes a hand-to-mouth living by working as a receptionist at the Hatros Institute while undergoing group therapy there. Though she ultimately loses the position due to a change in management, during her time there she received medication to suppress her pheromones so that she could exist among other people without producing any unwanted side-effects.  Jessica formed a strong friendship with fellow patient and aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe and developed acquaintances with several other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #13\u201320. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The next few months of Jessica's life are not covered by published stories. During this time, she appears publicly as Spider-Woman, becomes a [[bounty hunter]] working in partnership with [[paraplegic]] criminologist [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Scotty McDowell]], acquires a full wardrobe of disguises for use in her work, and finds a police liaison in Captain Walsh.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #21</ref> This situation lasts for several months. When her working relationship with Scotty fails, Jessica accepts an offer from Lindsay to move into an apartment with her in [[San Francisco]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> where she begins a romantic relationship with their landlord David Ishima,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref> and sets up a practice as a licensed private investigator.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her move there allows Lindsay to deduce her secret identity; she is unbothered by the danger involved in being Spider-Woman's friend, and the shared secret deepens the friendship between them.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #43. Lindsay implies that she had deduced Spider-Woman's identity following her first public appearance in San Francisco, which was in ''Spider-Woman'' #38.</ref>

While working as a private investigator, Jessica battles Morgan once again.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41</ref> Not long after that, she gives up her immunity powers to save [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #85. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her relationship with David Ishima develops to the point where she reveals her Spider-Woman identity to him, only to have him break up with her because he wants to be with an ordinary woman.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #49\u201350. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jessica travels in [[astral form]] with Magnus to 6th century England to free her friends' souls in a showdown with Morgan le Fey in the 6th century. She manages to vanquish Morgan, but her human body dies while her spirit was gone.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> At her request, Magnus places a spell over humanity to remove all memory of Jessica's existence. This spell is faulty, however; when [[Tigra]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] discover Jessica's dead body, they contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]]. The Avengers and Strange travel to the astral plane to battle Morgan Le Fay, who was trying to claim Jessica's body so she could return to the physical realm. Eventually, Doctor Strange and Magnus reunite Jessica's spirit with her human body, though Magnus's life and Jessica's powers are sacrificed to do so. She thus abandons her Spider-Woman identity<ref>''The Avengers'' #240\u2013241</ref> and continues her life as a private investigator in San Francisco, assisted by Lindsay McCabe and, for a time, by Tigra.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jessica and Lindsay take a job delivering the Black Blade to [[Japan]], but while passing through [[Madripoor]], she is enchanted by the blade. By this time, her superhuman strength and agility, and ability to cling to walls have returned. She is freed from the blade's power by Lindsay and an underworld figure called Patch,<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #1\u20133. Marvel Comics.</ref> whom she immediately recognizes as the X-Man [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #14</ref> Following the incident, she and Lindsay set up new business lodgings in Madripoor, with Patch as a frequent ally and information source.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #4\u20138, 10\u201316. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jessica Drew's life settles down until [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Charlotte Witter]], a villainess going by the Spider-Woman name, steals her powers and leaves her near death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jessica is taken from the hospital to New York City by [[Madame Web]] who directs her and [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] (yet another woman who has assumed the Spider-Woman name) to track down Witter. Under Madame Web's guidance, Franklin absorbs from Witter the powers of all four Spider-Women.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, Jessica remains with Madame Web for a time, helping her to watch over Mattie.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #3\u201311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jessica's powers gradually return to her during this time,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #4\u20135. Marvel Comics.</ref> but are now unreliable, failing her unexpectedly on occasion.<ref>''Alias'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For untold reasons, Jessica moves back to San Francisco, resuming her private investigator practice there.<ref>''Alias'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> When she hears that Mattie Franklin has gone missing, she goes to New York to find her. With the help of local P.I. [[Jessica Jones]], she rescues Mattie from a drug dealer who had abducted her and was cannibalizing her tissue to make the Mutant Growth Hormone.<ref>''Alias'' #19\u201321. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
One day, a HYDRA agent known as Connely offers her powers back if she would rejoin S.H.I.E.L.D. as a double agent.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/giant_size_spider_woman/001.html|title=''Giant-Size Spider-Woman''|volume=1|year=2005|access-date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> Knowing Connely would kill her if she says no, Jessica Drew contacts Nick Fury who confronts her securely and urges her to accept the offer.

Jessica is then paired with [[Spider-Man]] to do reconnaissance on Avengers Tower, where she reveals to him she is an agent of S.W.O.R.D. The duo are then found by Mandrill and Griffin who proceed to attack them. During the fight Mandrill gets close enough to Jessica and controls her into attacking Spider-Man.<ref>''New Avengers'' #61.

The duo trick Mandrill and Griffin into thinking Jessica has beaten Spider-Man and when they approach Spider-Woman to give her new commands, Jessica punches Mandrill in the face and shoves her hand in his mouth, firing off a venom blast and knocking him out.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:SW 5 Artgerm.jpg|thumb|Jessica's venom blasts. Variant cover of ''Spider-Woman'' #5.]]
After her mother, pregnant with Jessica, was struck with a beam of radiation containing the DNA of several different types of spiders, Jessica Drew developed superhuman powers patterned after several different types of spiders when she was born. Jessica is super-humanly strong and is able to lift around seven tons at her peak. She also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. Jessica's body is more resistant to injury than an ordinary person's, allowing her to take far more physical punishment compared to the average human. Jessica also possesses superhuman hearing and smell, the latter of which allowed her to distinguish a life-model decoy from the real Nick Fury.<ref>''New Avengers'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jessica's palms and soles secrete a special fluid that allows her to cling to solid objects, like a true spider. Jessica's physical makeup also makes her highly resistant to all terrestrial poisons, toxins, and completely immune to radiation. While she is typically rendered dizzy by the initial dose, she is completely immune to it after being exposed again. She also exudes a high concentration of pheromones that elicit pleasure and attraction from others, depending on unknown factors which might include gender and mood, although she typically uses a chemical \"perfume\" that renders these pheromones inert. This ability appears to be passive.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Gwen|volume=2|issue= #7|writer=[[Jason Latour]]|artist=Bengal|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> Jessica's body also produces an inordinate amount of bio-electrical energy which she can discharge from her hands.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McBeth |first=Susie |date=2014-08-05 |title=5 female superheroes that could lead the Spider-Man spinoff |url=https://metro.co.uk/2014/08/05/5-possible-female-superheroes-that-could-lead-the-new-sony-spider-man-spinoff-4821765/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Metro |language=en}}</ref> She refers to these discharges as \"venom blasts,\" although they actually have nothing to do with poison and typically cause pain and unconsciousness. Jessica can kill a person in the same way that a lightning bolt would and can pierce solid metals like steel by using her blasts at their greatest intensity. Jessica was also able to glide through unknown means using the web-like extensions of her costume but she seems to have gained the ability to fly after being replaced by the Skrull Queen, Veranke.{{issue|date=September 2013}} Jessica has lost her powers in numerous ways and on several occasions,{{issue|date=September 2013}} but after returning to Earth at the end of the Secret Invasion, Jessica's powers were restored and are greater than ever.{{issue|date=September 2013}}

In addition to her powers, she is a superb hand-to-hand combat fighter, and has trained in several styles of fighting including [[Boxing]], [[Capoeira]], [[Judo]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #34 (January 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Karate]] and [[Tai chi]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #40 (October 1981)</ref> learned under the training of the Taskmaster.<ref>''Spider-Woman Origin'' #2 (March 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> She has also had training in fencing and the use of many other weapons. Jessica was trained by HYDRA (and later on by S.H.I.E.L.D.) in covert operations, stealth, espionage, and information gathering and is a superb athlete.{{issue|date=September 2019}} She speaks several foreign languages, including Korean, Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German. Jessica has also received vocational training in undercover detective work and sometimes carries a [[Walther PPK]] handgun.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
James Whitbrook of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' referred to Jessica Drew as one of the \"greatest Spider-Women of all time,\" writing, \"There could only be one at the top of the list, and it\u2019s the one that really started it all. Created in a quick rush so Marvel could squat on the name to avoid rivals capitalizing on Spider-Man\u2019s success, Jessica Drew\u2019s story as Spider-Woman has seen her grow into a role and character that makes her so much more than the \u201cfemale Spider-Man\u201d her name might imply. Hell, she\u2019s always been her own damn hero\u2014over the years since her debut, Jessica has been a super spy, an Agent of SHIELD, an Avenger, a private investigator, and many other things, but most importantly, she\u2019s never been in Peter Parker\u2019s shadow, willingly far removed from the world of Spiders to do her own thing. She\u2019s always been a kickass, witty hero that\u2019s every-bit deserving of Spider-praise as her distant friend Peter.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-07-14 |title=The Greatest Spider-Women of All Time, Ranked |url=https://gizmodo.com/the-greatest-spider-women-of-all-time-ranked-1796904543 |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Gizmodo |language=en-us}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' called Jessica Drew one of the \"greatest Avengers of all time,\" saying, \"after living a life full of subterfuge, murder, and entanglements with the terrorist group H.Y.D.R.A., Jessica Drew joined up with the New Avengers during the super villain breakout at the Raft. Ever a controversial member because of her mother (she runs HYDRA), she must constantly deal with the judgment of her teammates (they don't trust her). To make matters worse, during the event Secret Invasion an Earth-shattering twist revealed that the Skrull Queen Veranke had been impersonating her since ''New Avengers'' #1. Luck has often not been on Drew's side, but she has proven her ability to rise above adversity and be every bit a hero as the next member. She is not the only member with a soiled reputation; in fact, she is currently romantically involved with the bad boy of the Avengers, Hawkeye. Her super strength and agility combined with her Venom Blast stunning ability make her a formidable opponent, and her personality adds a refreshing lightness to the team.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Spider-Woman - #20 Top Avenger - IGN |url=https://www.ign.com/lists/avengers/20 |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=www.ign.com}}</ref> Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' described Jessica Drew as a \"classic character,\" stating, \"Spider-Woman's new costume replaces a skintight spandex suit from the 70's with a more wearable look including a customized leather jacket. This superficial adjustment reflects a much deeper change to the character. It has been decades since Jessica Drew was featured in an ongoing solo title (''Spider-Woman: Agent of SWORD'' was originally planned as an ongoing in 2009, but altered to a mini-series) and ''Spider-Woman'' #5 is concerned primarily with defining her without the Avengers or a team-up. Spider-Woman is striking out from her previous affiliations in order to \"try living a normal life\". Normal is a relative concept though, and it appears that working as an urban crimefighter and investigator may be as close as it comes. Rodriguez's gorgeous new costume design is not the only part of Spider-Woman that looks great. He toys with panel compositions and sound effects in such a way as to make the entire reading experience a joy. He is a comics craftsman with a style that is still entirely his own. Just like Jessica Drew he is showing off the flexibility and potential of someone who has been involved in superhero comics for many years. [...] Spider-characters like Silk, Spider-Gwen, and Spider-Woman are filling the gap left behind by a grown-up Peter Parker; they're also more reflective of the readers who are interested in comics and superheroes. There's still a place for Spider-Man and his classic friends like The Human Torch and Daredevil, but there are more opportunities new heroes to join them. All of these women and other new characters like Ms. Marvel and the All-New Ghost Rider represent a new wave of superheroes. They are following in the footsteps of Spider-Man: a hero of the people who reflects our own concerns and worries (while going on fantastic adventures). And as time goes on they are reflecting the men and women who love those adventures better every year.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Spider-Women and The Changing Landscape of Marvel Comics |url=https://comicbook.com/news/spider-women-and-the-changing-landscape-of-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Comicbook.com |language=en}}</ref> Abdul R. Siddiqui of ''[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]'' stated, \"Critics love to argue that comics follow the traditional extremes of either portraying a damsel in distress or a femme fatale. However, if they were to actually study many of the prominent characters, they would see just how false this notion is. The best example to argue against such criticisms would be the role of Spider-Woman in ''Agent of S.W.O.R.D''. In terms of portrayal, protagonist Jessica Drew neither dons the virtuous garb of the diminutive, shy lady in waiting nor the leather-clad battle armor of the fighting vixen. Instead, the protagonist spends much of the series in loose trench coats or wife beater shirts more suited to a cage fighter than an attractive woman. At numerous points, she is shown bloodied and beaten to an inch of her life. Certainly, the portrayal does not make her physically beautiful but there is an abstract allure. Also, in terms of characterization, she is neither entirely pure of heart nor is she the conniving type that so strangely fascinates men in power. Instead, she is a woman whose drive for revenge actually demonstrates deep-seated fears of loneliness and betrayal. Even the motion comic picks a voice actress whose take on the character is in no way sultry, yet it is strangely unique and filled with emotion. Therefore, it is safe to say that no traditional criticism of the unrealistic standards or insulting portrayal of women in comics applies to this character and she can therefore not be called a sexist caricature. Instead, she is an individual with so much depth beyond that material that she instead represents ideals. Plus, keep in mind that she also has the ability to control the men around her through pheromones she secretes from her body, once again demonstrating the Petrarchan desire for the female to rule the man who finds her beautiful.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comics Books Are Not Sexist, But They Are Not Feminist Either |url=https://www.mic.com/articles/12032/comics-books-are-not-sexist-but-they-are-not-feminist-either |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Mic |language=en}}</ref> 

Kath Leroy of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to Jessica Drew as an \"iconic superheroine,\" saying, \"Marvel Comics has a very long tradition and during its decades of existence, they created hundreds of memorable stories, superheroes, and villains. One of the most popular Marvel superheroes is Spider-Man but he's not the only person with this set of powers, not by a long shot. There's also Spider-Woman. Multiple women have held this name but Jessica Drew is the most famous of them all. It will hardly come as a surprise she teamed up with Spider-Man on more than one occasion but she has a lot of going on in her life. Many fans like the courageous Spider-Woman and created amazing fan arts of her. Jessica Drew clearly knows where she stands, and it's not on the side of evil. Again, she might not be as famous as Spider-Man but that doesn't make her any less formidable, and it also doesn't mean she should be underestimated. Spider-Woman is very well able to protect those she cares about, whether it's the people around her, or the city she lives in.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leroy |first=Kath |date=2020-08-07 |title=Spider-Woman: 10 Fan Art Pictures You Have to See |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-woman-must-see-fan-art/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Joshua Isaak of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' described Jessica Drew as a \"beloved fan-favorite,\" stating, \"The superhero is unique among others within the Marvel Universe; Jessica Drew has a network of friends who know her true identity, she's a single mother, and her book routinely break the fourth wall without a Deadpool-like awareness of the medium or the reader. [...] Outside of the Skrull Veranke, Drew's most famous foes are enemies that already belong to other franchises, such as Juggernaut, the Enchantress and Madame Hydra. Others such as the Brothers Grimm are shadows of their former selves. This is perhaps why Drew is not as popular as her male counterpart. Spider-Woman is an excellent character cursed with a subpar rogues gallery and casual fans assuming a relationship with Spider-Man (as Drew herself reminds everyone, the two have different powers and aren't related except in name). Spider-Woman's villains have the right idea in attacking their enemy together, perhaps because they believe they won't be recognized alone.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Isaak |first=Joshua |date=2022-03-11 |title=Spider-Woman Deserves Better Villains (And Even They Seem To Know It) |url=https://screenrant.com/spider-woman-deserves-better-villains-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Stephanie Williams of ''[[Syfy]]'' said, \"Behind every great woman is an even greater friend. In the case of Carol Danvers, this friend is none other than Jessica Drew. Their friendship isn\u2019t at all one-sided, however. Jessica is great in her own right and Carol is right behind her when she needs the support. Spider-Woman and Captain Marvel are two women who were brought together by dire circumstances but instead of remaining stagnant in misery, a beautiful life-long friendship blossomed from their unthinkable pain. [...] Jessica or Carol are perfect superheroines, but their love for another regardless of each of their own shortcomings is a great reflection of their loving friendship. Hopefully, we continue to get much more bestie action from Jessica and Carol in the future. Superheroes make a job out of being there for those in need, but they can always use people in their corner for support as well. It's always refreshing to see them be there for one another.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-24 |title=Jessica Drew and Carol Danvers: best friends through thick and thin |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/jessica-drew-and-carol-danvers-best-friends-through-thick-and-thin |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=SYFY Official Site |language=en-US}}</ref> Anthony Orlando of ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' stated, \"Jessica Drew, aka Spider-Woman, has yet to receive the big-screen treatment she deserves. Though her origins have experienced confusing changes over the years, the main story is that she was given her superpowers before she was born and was recruited into HYDRA, fighting for the group until she discovered its true nature. Her character has recently grown more popular, and she has become a prominent member of the Avengers, making her an ideal new addition to the MCU or Sony's Spider-Verse.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Orlando |first=Anthony |title=12 Spider-Man Characters Sony Should Introduce After \"Morbius\" |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/spidey-characters-to-introduce |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=BuzzFeed |language=en}}</ref> 

Ryan Scott of ''[[SlashFilm]]'' wrote, \"With the MCU showing absolutely no signs of slowing down, we recently decided to poll some fans to determine which superhero they would most like to see join the MCU down the line. While there are many options, one hero stood well above the rest of the competition, and it is a wish that may well come true down the line, if the stars align.

Sure, we got a glimpse of Gwen Stacy\u2019s Spider-Woman in an alternate universe from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and while that movie was one of the best Spider-Man films we\u2019ve been given, it was still ultimately just that\u2014a Spider-Man film. Introducing Jessica Drew\u2019s Spider-Woman is just the shake-up the MCU needs. Not only does Drew have the same powers as Peter Parker\u2019s Spider-Man, but she\u2019s also a super spy and private investigator. Think Natasha Romanoff\u2019s Black Widow meets Jessica Jones.

She\u2019s a character who\u2019s been an Avenger more often than Spider-Man in the comics, and she\u2019s extremely powerful, thanks to her venom blasts. She\u2019s also recently been pregnant\u2014a rare status for a superhero.

Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew, was first introduced in 1977\u2019s Marvel Spotlight #32. She was invented simply to make sure that no one else took the moniker first, but after her popularity surprised Marvel she was given an ongoing series. Jessica has an interesting origin as she was originally written as a woman who evolved from a literal spider, but that was retconned within five issues, and in current continuity she\u2019s actually a clone of Peter Parker. Her iconic red and yellow costume, flowing hair, and her own animated series have made her a fan favorite and most likely to be the first Spider-Woman to appear on screen! So if you\u2019re looking for a place to get to know her, the 2015 Spider-Woman series by Dennis Hopeless and Javier Rodriguez is a great place to start.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=5 Spider-Women Who Could Be in the SPIDER-WOMEN Movie |url=https://nerdist.com/article/spider-women-movie-spider-woman-spider-girl/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Nerdist |language=en-US}}</ref>

Nick Winstead of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' called ''Spider-Woman'' #1 \"much-anticipated,\" stating, \"This first issue is the first opportunity we've been allowed to see Jessica's deepest thoughts and feelings on her situation, and coupled with the scenes of quiet introspection are some very darkly drawn panels from Maleev, accenting the loneliness and self-imposed exile in which Drew currently finds herself. Brand's approach to her about taking the job as a sort of \"alien hunter\" is an intriguing new direction for her, given that her first solo series in the 1980's dealt so much with magical foes, mystery solving and encounters with costumed criminals. Brand's offer sparks Drew to take off to, of course, Madripoor, the epicenter of shady characters and criminals in the Marvel universe. [...] This first issue jumps out to an impressive start, and the pacing is quick and immediate, with the reader able to be engaged throughout. Maleev's art is the perfect compliment to the narrative, and there's a great amount of tension in what Drew tells us about her current life. Perhaps her new journey will reinspire her to carve out her destiny and identity, free of any other organization's machinery.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Spider-Woman #1 Bites With a Purpose! |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/spider-woman-1-bites-with-a-purpose/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref> Bryan Joel of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Spider-Woman'' #1 a grade of 8.2 out of 10, writing, \"''Spider-Woman'' is no doubt going to gain footnote status for spearheading Marvel's motion comics initiative. But what shouldn't be forgotten about the series in ten years' time is that its first issue is surprisingly good. Brian Michael Bendis bucks his own trend of decompression in this issue, and this issue shows ''Spider-Woman'' has a good deal on its plate. The book details Jessica Drew's mental status post-''Secret Invasion'', a run-in with Abigail Brand and subsequent drafting into S.W.O.R.D., and deployment on her first official mission. Bendis covers a lot of ground here, even finding time to give a quick refresher on Jessica's origin along the way. It bears mentioning that the issue is well-paced, and gives each plot beat and development room to do its thing. [...] ''Spider-Woman'' is off to a strong start. There's certainly room for improvement, but it's nice to know Jessica Drew isn't the next in the string of properties Marvel has given an ongoing series with minimal direction or reason.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Joel |first=Bryan |date=2009-09-24 |title=Spider-Woman #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/24/spider-woman-1-review |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Spider-Woman'' #1 a grade of C, asserting, \"''Spider-Woman'' #1 is an issue that starts with its hands tied behind its back. It never has an opportunity to introduce its characters or premise because it's too busy attempting to catch up with an event. However, Hopeless does an admirable job of providing a reason to care about these characters. Land's negligible contribution doesn't actively harm the story, but fails to take advantage of the ample opportunities here. Spider-Woman holds potential, but has a lot of hurdles to overcome in order to develop its own personality and appearance.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aquaman Star Jason Momoa Shaves Off His Hair |url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/aquaman-star-jason-momoa-shaves-off-his-hair/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Movies |language=en}}</ref> Jeff Lake of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Spider-Woman'' #1 a grade of 5 out of 10, saying, \"Spider-Woman was already facing an uphill battle, the book's infamous \"butt cover\" and oddly time dependent release casting a shadow over Jessica Drew's long awaited return. Those hoping that the debut itself would alleviate such negative connotations are sure to be left disappointed, as Spider-Woman's new #1 proves uneven and ill-formed, serving as little more than a drawn out tie-in to the ongoing events of Spider-Verse. [...] When all is said and done, ''Spider-Woman'' #1 isn\u2019t a true debut. As a direct tie-in to Spider-Verse it's a decent enough addition, offering Spider-folk aplenty, but if you're looking for an immersive look at a returning fan favorite, this isn't it. The book's last second shift may serve to rectify some of these aforementioned misgivings, but unless you're a lover of all things Spider-Verse, the book's current direction leaves much to be desired. Whether felled by undue expectation or confusing marketing, ''Spider-Woman'' #1 feels more like an ensemble piece than a true solo debut. Fans of the Spider-Verse event will likely find more to like, but for those excited to see Jessica Drew return to prominence, it appears we have more waiting to do yet.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lake |first=Jeff |date=2014-11-20 |title=Spider-Woman #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/20/spider-woman-1-review-2 |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Focusing purely, or even largely, on that one aspect does a disservice to the comic though. ''Spider-Woman'' #1 is a story about a woman handling her first pregnancy, but it is so much more. It is a story about friends helping one another, about altering one's career, about comedic party shenanigans, and about wild, space adventures. Spider-Woman #1 is one of the most colorful stories in the All-New, All-Different Marvel, a beautifully presented joy of a read. [...] ''Spider-Woman'' #1 is one of the absolute best debuts of the All-New, All-Different Marvel line. It is an example of what a team of excellent creators can do when collaborating on a story and craft they clearly care about. The pregnancy storyline is handled very well here, but it speaks volumes about the quality of this comic that it is far from the only thing with discussing. There's a lot of great things happening in Spider-Woman, and it would be a shame for superhero fans to miss out on any of them.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Advance Review: Spider-Woman #1 a Beautifully Presented Joy of a Read |url=https://comicbook.com/news/spider-woman-1-packs-a-whole-lot-into-a-little-package/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Comicbook.com |language=en}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Spider-Woman'' #1 a grade of 8.6 out of 10, writing, \"It's nice (if not terribly surprising) to see that Rodriguez is able to juggle the outlandish on down-to-earth elements so well. The story is laid back at times and outlandish at others, and Rodriguez brings a unified look to it all. Rodriguez's page layouts stand out thanks to their variety and strong sense of design. At times he relies on smaller, grid-like layouts, while at other times the page opens up and allows Rodriguez's elegant figure-work to breathe. Rodriguez also colors this issue, and his vibrant hues do a lot to enhance the story. Whether it's the moody glow of a fire in the early pages or the eclectic hues seen in the final sequence, Rodriguez's work leaves a strong impression. Granted, the cover is a little wonky in terms Jessica's posture and proportions, but generally the figure work is much stronger inside the comic. The only thing new about this series is the status quo. But considering how little time we got to savor Dennis Hopeless and Javier Rodriguez's Spider-Woman before Secret Wars cut things short, and changes to the creative team would be a disappointment. This first issue makes the most of the book's core character dynamics as Jessica grapples with her new life as a superhero mother-to-be. This issue even opens up her world to bigger and crazier conflicts again, promising an exciting road ahead for Spider-Woman.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2015-11-16 |title=Spider-Woman #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/16/spider-woman-1-review-3 |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

==== ''Spider-Woman'' - 2020 ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond Comics Distributors]], ''Spider-Woman'' #1 was the best selling comic book in March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: March 2020 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/242163-Top-100-Comics-March-2020 |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Spider-Woman #1 Is March's Bestselling Comic, Marvel Top Publisher |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/bestselling-comics-march-2020-diamond-marvel-dc-image/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=MacDonald |first=Heidi |date=2020-04-29 |title=Syndicated Comics |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/ispider-woman-1-leads-march-comics-sales-in-a-very-strange-month/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=The Beat |language=en-US}}</ref>

Joe Grunenwald of ''[[ComicsBeat]]'' stated, This series marks her first ongoing work for Marvel, and the two tales in this issue display Pacheco\u2019s deft ear for dialogue and a skill for characterization. Jess narrates both stories, and newcomers to the character will really get a sense of who she is as a result. The first story is nearly all action, while the second is more dialogue-heavy and character-driven, and Pacheco\u2019s scripting on both of them is clever and solidly entertaining. The visuals in this issue are equally strong. Pere P\u00e9rez illustrates the opening, more action-oriented tale, and he does so wonderfully. His action is dynamic and easy to follow, and his facial expressions are also spot-on, driving home the humor and the intensity of Pacheco\u2019s script. The issue\u2019s second story, illustrated by Paulo Siqueira and Oren Junior, is just as well-done, with clean lines and interesting page layouts keeping the dialogue-heavier story visually interesting. Colors by Frank D\u2019Armata unify both stories, and he noticeably adjusts his work to match each artist/art team to great effect. The result is a visually-cohesive package that\u2019s a pleasure to take in. [...] ''Spider-Woman'' #1 is an engaging and entertaining debut issue for the series. It raises several questions I\u2019m interested in getting answers for, and it sets up Jessica Drew\u2019s new goings-on in a way that\u2019s clever, and that enhances the reading experience. This is worth checking out. Final Verdict: BUY this book if you like solid writing and art that tells an intriguing story with a fan-favorite character.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=Beat |date=2020-03-18 |title=Syndicated Comics |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/the-marvel-rundown-outlawed-1-spider-woman-1-reviews/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=The Beat |language=en-US}}</ref> Matthew Aguilar of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Spider-Woman'' #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, saying, \"Spider-Woman's new series is finally here and it absolutely delivers. We've never seen a take on Spider-Woman quite like this, and we mean that in the best possible way. Writer Karla Pacheco brings Drew's trademark banter to the series in spades but gives it all some welcome edge, like say when she uses a jerky kid as an impromptu projectile in the middle of a fight. Spider-Woman is also made to look like the true badass she is thanks to Pere Perez and Frank D'Armata, who find inventive ways to showcase her power set throughout the issue. It should also be said that the new costume looks pretty slick in their capable hands, though we also have to mention the second story explaining the new suit. The story itself is great, providing proper context for the new suit and a compelling hook along with it, but the cheesecake style art here is going to be too much for some, looking way out of proportion to the version earlier in the book. That aside, this is one hell of a debut, and Spider-Woman couldn't be in better hands.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 3/18/2020 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/new-comic-reviews-dc-marvel-image-314774/ |access-date=2022-09-06 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>
