'''Khn'nr''' is a character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] and [[Tom Raney]], the character first appeared in ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: The Return'' (March [[2007 in comics|2007]]). Khn'nr was a [[Skrull]] sleeper agent posing as the [[Kree]] [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]] (also known as '''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''').

The [[shapeshifting]] Skrull Khn'nr was bonded with the [[DNA]] of Mar-Vell to lock his body into Mar-Vell's form and given technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands. However, his mental conditioning was botched, causing Khn'nr's personality to be erased and leaving the Mar-Vell persona dominant. Though part of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of [[Earth]], this Captain Marvel decides to fight against the invading Skrulls.

==Publication history==
In 2007, Mar-Vell supposedly returned to the [[Marvel Universe]] during Marvel's ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' crossover storyline. He made his appearance in the \"Civil War: The Return\" [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]].<ref name=\"CACM\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/every-captain-marvel-ranked/|title=Every Captain Marvel Ever, Officially Ranked - 12|last=Webber|first=Tim|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 22, 2018|accessdate=June 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723105401/https://www.cbr.com/every-captain-marvel-ranked/|archivedate=July 23, 2018}}</ref> It was later revealed that this was in fact a Skrull named Khn'nr during the 2008 ''Captain Marvel'' mini-series, which spun out of the events of his ''Civil War'' appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/9-captain-marvel-comics-history-shazam/|title=The Comics History of All 9 CAPTAIN MARVELS|last=Diaz|first=Eric|website=[[Nerdist]]|date=March 14, 2019|accessdate=June 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330112340/https://nerdist.com/article/9-captain-marvel-comics-history-shazam/|archivedate=March 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Whatculture\">{{cite web|url=https://whatculture.com/comics/captain-marvel-12-major-characters-from-the-comics-you-need-to-know?page=2|title=Captain Marvel: 12 Major Characters From The Comics You Need To Know - 11.

==Fictional character biography==
As part of the Skrull [[Secret Invasion]], a shapeshifting Skrull called Khn'nr was locked into the shape of [[Mar-Vell]], the first [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and given technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands to replicate Captain Marvel's powers. Khn'nr received memory implants to turn him into a sleeper agent making him believe he was Captain Marvel supposedly up until the time of the invasion when a psychological trigger would be activated to return him to his Skrull persona.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

The real Mar-Vell died of cancer so to explain his comeback from death, a false memory was implanted in the Skrull Mar-Vell to make him believe he had encountered a wrinkle in space-time in the past, supposedly caused by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Hank Pym]], and [[Reed Richards]]' construction of a prison within the [[Negative Zone]], which Captain Marvel touched and was transported through time to the Negative Zone in the present day. Initially unsure of how to approach the situation, the Earth's heroes revealed Mar-Vell's history to him but also offered him a place in this new future as a warden for their prison, at least until, as the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] implicated, Mar-Vell would return to his past.<ref>''Civil War: The Return'' (March 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is later called in to help the [[Registration Acts (comics)|pro-registration heroes]] who revived him, at the end of the 2007 \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline;<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #7 (January 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> however upon seeing the chaos they are causing, he departs, to [[France]], where he spends all of his time observing a painting of [[Alexander the Great]] in the [[Louvre]] and contemplates Alexander's similarities to himself.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 6 #1 (January 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> This painting is meant to be his psychological trigger, but due to an error in the methods of Skrull scientists, Mar-Vell retains his personality and memories prior to his Skrull captivity in their entirety. Most of Khn'nr's personality had accidentally been erased as a byproduct of the botched mental conditioning. Consequently, the Mar-Vell persona remains defiantly dominant.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

When the Skrulls realize what happened, other Skrull agents posing as supervillains [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)#Andr\u00e9 Gerard|Cyclone]], [[Cobalt Man]], and a team of Kree soldiers<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 7 #3 (March 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> unsuccessfully attempt to capture Captain Marvel.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

When he learned the truth and became fully aware of his true identity he decides to embrace Mar-Vell's memories and rebel against the Skrulls and protect Earth from their invasion.<ref name=\"CM5\">''Captain Marvel'' vol. 6 #5 (June 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, at the same time that Skrull infiltrators strike [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[S.W.O.R.D.

Barely alive after his effort, he manages to crash back on Earth, crossing [[Noh-Varr]]'s path, who briefly mistakes him for the original Mar-Vell. Before dying from his wounds, Khn'nr spurs Noh-Varr into continuing Mar-Vell's legacy as the protector of Earth, branding with his dying words the Skrulls as liars and traitors and asking that Noh-Varr defeat the Skrulls and take on the mantle of Captain Marvel, which Noh-Varr does, joining the [[Dark Avengers]] under that name.<ref name=\"IGN\"/><ref name=\"SI6\">''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Though a Skrull, Khn'nr has the memories, knowledge, and skills of the Kree, Mar-Vell;<ref name=\"IGN\"/> presumably  including Mar-Vell's Kree military training giving him mastery of all forms of Kree unarmed combat, as well as extensive knowledge of the technologically advanced vehicles and devices of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Whatculture\"/> It is unknown if the botched mental conditioning has left Khn'nr any of his previous Skrull knowledge.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

The Skrulls also developed technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands, though it is unknown if these work in the same fashion as the Kree version which converted Mar-Vell's [[psionic]] energy into strength, a high degree of imperviousness to harm, the ability to project force blasts, survive in space and the power to fly at faster-than-light speeds, the bands do give him exactly the same powers. They are also fully compatible with the originals, as seen when [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], armed with the original Nega-Bands is able to banish him in the [[Negative Zone]] by clicking her wrist on his.<ref name=\"CM5\"/>

Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Captain Marvel'' #1 a grade of 8.6 out of 10, writing, \"Brian Reed and Lee Weeks wouldn't have topped my list for a killer ''Captain Marvel'' team (no pun intended), but they certainly make a case for themselves. Reed is increasingly proving that he can easily survive without his frequent writing partner Brian Michael Bendis. Reed's own voice shines through in this issue, particularly with some well-written narration by Mar-Vell. Weeks, despite not qualifying as a very traditional superhero artist, is a near-perfect fit for this mini-series. In many ways Weeks evokes memories of [[Jim Starlin]]'s work on ''The Death of Captain Marvel''. If this series is eliciting favorable comparisons to that classic story already, I think we're in for a marvelously good time (har har).\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2007-11-15 |title=Captain Marvel #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/15/captain-marvel-1-review |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Captain Marvel'' #2 a grade of 8.7 out of 10, saying, \"Lee Weeks is a name that hasn't graced many Marvel covers lately, but I hope that will change after this mini-series. Weeks is one of many similarly-accomplished noir artists at Marvel. His stark, realistic pencils aren't what I would have initially expected from this book, but his style wound up being a perfect fit. I highly recommend giving this series a look if you're still on the fence. I just don't think any supposed connection to ''Secret Invasion'' should be a motivating factor.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2007-12-28 |title=Captain Marvel #2 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/28/captain-marvel-2-review |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>
