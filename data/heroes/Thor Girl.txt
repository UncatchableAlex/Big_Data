==Fictional character biography==
In the beginning of time, an alien sorcerer named X'Hoss foretold the creation of the Designate, who will help evolve sentient beings to the next level of existence. Billions of years later, Tarene is born. She is told about the fate of the evil [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and together with others seeks a way to stop him. In the meantime, [[Thanos]] (later retconned as a clone) obtains X'Hoss' knowledge and destroys Tarene's home-world. With [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor's]] help, she defeats him.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' Vol 2 #25 (July 2000)</ref>

Tarene later transforms herself into an [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] goddess and becomes Thor's loyal ally, taking the name \"Thor Girl\" and the human identity of Jake Olson's \"cousin\" Tara.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #34 (April 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> She tries to assist Thor in his adventures, aiding him in his confrontations with [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]],<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #34-35 (2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> and Nullitor.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #33 (March 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> She is transferred into the shell of the Destroyer by Loki, causing her to fight Thor. With the help of [[Enchantress (comics)|Amora]], they find Tarene's body and [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] casts her back into her body, where she takes her vengeance on Loki.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #36-38 (2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> In a later battle against a revived [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] she sacrifices nearly all of her cosmic powers to contribute the additional power needed to defeat him.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #38 (August 2001)</ref> Upon Odin's apparent death, Thor Girl loses most of her cosmic powers.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #40 (October 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> She retains the powers she had as Thor Girl.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #41 (November 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Blunden |first=Fred |date=2017-04-22 |title=Thor's 16 Greatest Hammers, Ranked! |url=https://screenrant.com/thor-mjolnir-best-hammers-ranked/ |access-date=2023-02-06 |website=ScreenRant |language=en}}</ref> She returns to Earth in an attempt to live a normal life as Tara Olson, but is also seen adventuring occasionally. She knows that she is destined to, and one day will, regain her full power and then some, to become the Designate.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Thor Girl is one of the heroes who registers with the Superhuman Registration Act that was forged during the 2006-2007 \"[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]\" storyline. After the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, Thor Girl interferes in a jewel theft undertaken by the [[Grey Gargoyle]], a previous foe of hers, and dispatches him, preventing the jewel heist in the process. In return, the Grey Gargoyle undertakes a lawsuit with the assistance of Mallory Book at the Superhuman Law Offices of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Thor Girl is one of the first recruits for the [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] training facility. Other trainees included: [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], [[Rage (comics)|Rage]], and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Initiative recruits are sent as crowd control in Manhattan with Thor Girl aiding mass evacuation when the city is attacked by the [[Hulk]], who is seeking revenge upon the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]. However, Rage breaks ranks to try to help the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against the Hulk and his [[Warbound]], and Thor Girl is among the trainees who sides with Rage. Easily defeated, Thor Girl and the others are imprisoned at Manhattan Square Gardens and controlled by obedience disks. The Initiative's black ops team, including the empathic metamorph Trauma, are sent in to free Thor Girl and her compatriots, with Trauma assuming the form and powers of Thor as he battles the Warbound, leaving Thor Girl awestruck by the encounter.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Subsequent to Trauma's assumption of Thor's form, Thor Girl has expressed a kind of hero worship of and becomes enamored with Trauma.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} However, both Tarene and Trauma are brutally attacked by the [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] clone, calling himself KIA (Killed In Action). Tarene is badly burned while protecting Trauma, who is then stabbed in the chest by KIA.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thor Girl recovers fairly quickly. At first, she assists in a mass super-human effort dedicated to rebuilding New York.<ref>''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control'' #1-3 (March 2008)</ref> Later, she is assigned together with [[Ultra Girl]] to the Cavalry, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s local superhero team, once her Initiative training is complete.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the [[Skrull]] [[Dum Dum Dugan]] calls all the sleeper agents in the Initiative, causing Ultra Girl and Thor Girl to fight each other out of fear. When the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] arrives to the scene, [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] confirms that Thor Girl is a Skrull, killing her with her own hammer with the help of [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref> It is unclear at this point how long the Skrull agent had been impersonating Thor Girl.

After the invasion is over, the real Thor Girl is shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> She attends a therapy session with Trauma, when Camp Hammond is attacked by the Thor clone [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]]. The clone beats Thor Girl badly, until [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] intervenes.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Thor Girl joins Steve Rogers' New Initiative, under [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]]'s leadership. She is quite confused about why Odin took all of the Asgardians back to the Asgard Realm, and is still deciding as to whether she should join them. While saving some people in the city, she is attacked because she has a hammer similar to those which had been appearing all around the earth, and accidentally kills a police officer who shot at her by deflecting the bullets back into him. At Prodigy's request she turns herself in and is kept in a holding cell. But when she is accosted by men outside the cell, who attempted to interrogate her as to the nature of the Worthy, Cloud 9 arrives to rescue her and subdues the men. After defeating [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]], who was on a murder spree, they joined in the battle against [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in Las Vegas and rescued civilians. Due to a misunderstanding she was attacked by the other heroes, despite her attempts to explain herself or she was only acting in defense. During the battle, her designate powers returned. She declared Earth's heroes to be little better than those who tortured her and as a whole proof that humanity is still too flawed to be worthy of ascending. She left Earth for the stars.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt'' #1-6</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
As Thor Girl, Tarene possesses the conventional physical attributes of Asgardian gods. She is highly durable, able to withstand attacks that would destroy an ordinary human. If she were somehow wounded in battle, her godly life-force enables faster recovery time. Thor Girl has immense strength, which rivals even the most powerful gods and this now Asgardian-level [[metabolism]] provides her with greater stamina than normal beings. Additionally, like most Asgardians, she is also effectively immortal and immune to all Earth-based diseases.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 1 #12 (January 2010)</ref> When she had her [[Cosmos|cosmic]] [[Power (physics)|powers]], the full extent of them are unknown, but closely rivaled to Odin's.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' Vol 2 #24 (June 2000)</ref>

===Tarene's Hammer===
Thor Girl wields a golden [[hammer]] through when thrown, she can channel her energies as continuous beams, capable of knocking Thor off his feet and shattering buildings. Like Thor, she can also utilize it to fly, control the weather, and traverse dimensional barriers, such as from Earth to Asgard.<ref>''Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide'' Vol 1 #2 (March 2015)</ref>
